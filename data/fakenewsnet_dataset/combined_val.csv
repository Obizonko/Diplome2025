into thecrowds like they did yesterday on friday they were supposed to bethe first line of defense around a un building where seven unworkers were killed they were not able to keep those workers keepthose protesters out of that un building and us officials are deeply concerned about that because theplace where that happened mazarisharif is the first city that issupposed to transfer to afghan

and now more bad news for the makeshift rebelforces nato warplanes seem to have mistakenly bombed one of theirconvoys another blow in a week where theyve seen most of theirgains against gadhafi wiped out just monday the rebels were within striking distance ofcapturing gadhafis home town of sirt and they had the capitaltripoli in their sites but by weeks end they were beating a hastyretreat with gadhafi forces once again in control of the long stretchof coastline our reporters in libya have been tracking all of this jeffreykaufman just arrived in tripoli and alex marquardt joins us from therebel bastion of benghazi lets start with jeffrey jeffrey in tripoli any signs of the tension or that maybegadhafi is on his last few days jeffrey kaufman abc correspondent well actually just momentsago we heard a nato warplane flying above us we didnt hear anybombs dropping but you know its actually remarkably normal hereyou can see the traffic behind me on the highway as we came in we saw a lot of military checkpoints long linesfor gasoline a lot of shops closed but the tension is not palpableat this point the rebels are clearly on the retreat really whatwere seeing now in libya is a divided country almost two countriesthe rebelheld east and the gadhafiheld west and neither one seems to have the strength right now to unseatthe other certainly the rebels arent organized enough mannedenough or skilled enough to come to tripoli and gadhafi it seemsthe coalition will not let him go further east and retake thosevaluable oil fields in those areas so right now the word to describe this revolution weeks into itis stalemate christiane amanpour jeffrey thank you you mentioned stalemate and alsodivided country and joining me now from the rebelheld city ofbenghazi is abcs alex marquardt alex how are these rebels dealing with being unable to reallycapitalize on all of the help the nofly zone is giving them alex marquardt abc correspondent christiane theyre not ableto capitalize because they are outmanned they are outgunned and theyare not able to organize they dont have the weapons to facegadhafis superior firepower so theyre forced to beat a retreat they dont have any sort of leadership so when they retreatthey do so in a disorganized fashion very quickly no one showingthem how to hold the line how to retreat so were seeing now glimmers of hope that theyll be able toorganize experienced officers on the frontlines trying to corralthese groups into units keeping people back without any sort oftraining and for the first time on the frontlines on friday we saw thegeneral who is technically in charge of these forces general abdelfattah yunis welcomed with a heros welcome so signs that there issome leadership coming to the frontlines that is so

the moment this pastor who burned thekoran is unrepentant do you think despite the freedoms envisionedand expressed specifically in the american constitution he should nothave burned that koran jones oh i dont think he should have done that at all ithink its extremely irresponsible and look at what it has led to amanpour you also heard mike boettchers report a fiercefirefight along the pakistani border one of the worst that theamericans had been involved in right now do you think the unitedstates forces can pull down significantly in july jones well i think that there can be and there will be somereduction of force in keeping with the agreement made at portugal atthe nato summit in december to target 2014 as in president karzaisown words at the london conference this is when i want to be able tocontrol my entire country amanpour but can it be done responsibly if youd like jones yes i think so i think it can be done responsiblyand well have to see what it looks like a lot of it hinges on whathappens on the other side of the border with our friends the ourneighbors the pakistanis if pakistan turns to what some of us think they should have donemore effectively for a long period of time now attacking and removingthose safe havens that cause us so much difficulties and if we canget some sort of coordination with their forces then i think you canin fact crosstalk amanpour you say if you dont seem convinced that theyreplaying their part jones well i dont im not convinced i think there wassome good progress made in the swat valley and in north waziristan ayear or so ago but it hasnt been sustained there still seems tobe that reluctance to engage comprehensively and buy into an overallplan that would i think really help pakistan in the long term amanpour all right general

states do you agree jones i agree with that amanpour you agree that its not in the vital interest jones i agree that its not a vital interest in the sense thatit affects the security the vital security of the nation but weare part of an alliance we are one of the global leaders if not theglobal leader and we have to do it is in the vital interest more in the vital interest of europeans when you consider the effectsof massive immigration the effects of terror the effects of the oilmarket amanpour so the united states is now in it you can call itwhat you want but its a third armed conflict jones were a part of it we are transitioning to a supportingpart only the united states could have gotten there as quickly as itdid amanpour the united states is making a great fanfare about nowgiving

politifact7259,1,nra president david keene rejects white house gun control approach pbs newshour jan 15 2013 judy woodruff we come back now to the gun story and were joined by david keene hes president of the national rifle association welcome to the newshour david keene national rifle association thank you for having me judy woodruff so earlier on the program we heard from the governor of delaware jack markell who said the critics who argue that what theyre trying to do by limiting gun violence and say that its an attack on the second amendment are not right he said what were simply doing are commonsense safety measures david keene thats what michael bloomberg says no it is an attack on the second amendment it is an attack on those americans who purchased and legally use firearms who have never committed a criminal act who have never done anything wrong and they can say that it doesnt infringe upon their rights but in fact it does now every amendment the first amendment you cant famously yell fire in a crowded theater the second amendment is also subject to reasonable limits the supreme court has held that but theyre strictly looked at and you have to demonstrate that they really impact things and that theyre really necessary and the problem that we have is that none of the things that they have suggested are going to do any good theyre asking the question judy what do we do about guns the question should be what do we do to prevent the kinds of things that happened in connecticut and we dont think that theyre asking that question but theyre pursuing their own agenda judy woodruff well they say thats what theyre doing david keene i know they do judy woodruff and let me just quickly read from something that gabby giffords the former congresswoman who was gravely wounded mark kelly her husband they wrote an oped article just a few days ago they say people who are just he said special interests have cast have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties and they say as a result more people are vulnerable to gun violence david keene you know theyre talking about what they call assault weapons actually an assault weapon socalled wasnt involved in the giffords shooting but the fact of the matter is that we have heard time and time again that these are military weapons designed for the battlefield theyre not theyre semiautomatic commercial rifles the ar15 is the bestselling long gun in the united states there are over three million of them that have been purchased by people most people that have them use them for sport shooting for hunting and for the like and to take those guns away from them for no reason is an infringement on their rights judy woodruff so the mother of one of the victims in aurora colo was visiting newtown just yesterday and she specifically talked about the ar15 these assault weapons and she said they dont belong in the hands of people in the community what do you say to what her name is judy woodruff phillips david keene it was interesting judy because judy woodruff what do you say to her david keene because were talking anybody who dies in a tragedy whether its an auto accident or beaten to death or knifed or killed by a gun it is tragic and i can understand her reaction to that but in this country last year more people were in fact beaten to death than killed by all long arms including assault socalled assault weapons the semiautomatic rifle has been in this country and available to people since 1806 in our museum we have got one that fired 20 rounds from a magazine a magazine that would be banned by some people that lewis and clark took with them on their expedition its been that long and were talking were talking about something that has no impact we have tried to do that as a society before it hasnt made any difference judy woodruff well we can argue about the statistics i mean what is out there david keene right people do that judy woodruff 70 percent of the violent deaths last year were due had a gun involved but specifically david keene what about what were hearing from the president that there is going to be an attempt to ban the assault weapon that there will be a proposal for comprehensive background checks is there where is there any common ground between the position of the nra and the white house david keene yes there is some common ground its not on banning rifles that we dont think would make any difference and its not on setting up a national gun registry but we have for 20 years been asking that those people who have been adjudicated to be mentally potentially violent be put on the lists of people who are not allowed to buy firearms when you go into a store to buy a gun or if you go to a gun show to buy a gun from a licensed dealer they have to check your background the fbi keep databases of people who are not allowed to buy guns felons and the like we have been urging that these people be put on these lists and nothing has happened twentythree states dont put any on the list now one of the things we have to do is keep firearms out of the hands of people who shouldnt have them and we can do that partly in that way the problem is you can never predict in a society who is going to do what judy woodruff right david keene so you also have to provide security and thats what we have been proposing in terms of the schools judy woodruff and thats why and thats and you mentioned mental illness and that is something the administration is going to talk about maybe theres some common ground there when it comes to guards putting armed guards gov markell said earlier on the program that he said how would you know where to put a guard how many to put he said its really an impractical thing to david keene sure well i dont think that its impractical you know just by coincidence i was in israel the day after the newtown shooting and i was touring a facility where they in fact train guards for their schools because they had a spate of shootings in the 1970s their crazy people are a little different from ours but the results were the same and they first used volunteers now each school provides its own through private security guards and i was a place where they train these people it works there it was a sensible thing for them to do after columbine president clinton proposed what he called the cops program and about 28000 schools in this country now either have police through that program or police that are paid for by the state or private security guards those schools have them now and it is theres an argument the argument against it is just what you said but the fact is if you look at the people who do this first of all theyre mentally deranged and secondly theyre cowards and the fact that theres somebody armed there will prevent them in most cases from doing anything can you do we live in a perfect world no but we can do what makes sense to protect our kids judy woodruff well speaking of whats not perfect what about trying some of the solutions that the folks who are saying theyre not trying to attack the second amendment are saying they simply want to make they want to reduce gun violence why not try reducing highcapacity ammunition clips why not try a ban on assault weapons david keene well we tried a ban on assault weapons the only thing that is different is and remember judy that an assault weapon has to be listed because theres no functional difference between a socalled assault weapon and any other semiautomatic rifle so this time theyre saying well if it has a pistol grip its dangerous if it doesnt have a pistol grip it isnt dangerous now thats absurd from a functional standpoint because its the same gun the same rifle and the only difference is cosmetic so banning something for cosmetic reasons is not going to cause is not going to cure the problem judy woodruff but youre not saying theres couldnt reasonable people sit down at the table and come up with a solution that would satisfy you your organization and would satisfy those who say we have got to make it safer david keene thats why we went to the meeting with vice president biden but you know before that meeting the vice president himself and those speaking for him said were openminded were going to discuss this we got to the meeting and one of the first things he said was the president and i have strong feelings about firearms and nobody is going to change our mind on that were going to pursue what we want to pursue fine they had the meeting so they could say oh and we talked to the nra judy woodruff well and i happened to talk to someone in the white house because i had heard you say something similar to that in another interview and they say thats not what was said in the meeting david keene well it is and the other thing let me say one other thing in the last year 77000 people who were on the prohibited list tried to buy firearms that in itself is a crime you know how many have been prosecuted seventy when that was raised at the meeting the attorney general said well we dont have the resources and the time to be going after those people those people are the potential criminals whom were trying to keep guns out of the hands of but the government doesnt have time to do anything about them they do have time to try and prohibit legitimate citizens from owning firearms judy woodruff very quickly david keene the new polls show that are out that show even in gunowning households people are saying by large percentages we need to do something about again highcapacity ammunition clips assault weapons background checks david keene well actually interestingly the gallup poll showed no change at all on the socalled assault weapon question i consider that evidence of the fact that people are smarter than politicians but given the publicity and everything im surprised that there hasnt been more of an immediate reaction but when we get into this when we begin to discuss it and remember its sort of deja vu because we have had this discussion before once the discussion takes place and people think about the substance of it im confident that the judgment of the american people is going to be as it was before and that is that second amendment rights should be protected criminals should be prosecuted and we should strengthen the ways we keep guns out of the hands of people who have no business buying them judy woodruff david keene president of the nra we thank you for being with us tonight david keene my pleasure as always thank you

politifact11314,1,has the potency of pot changed since president obama was in high school apparently back when president barack obama would get high with the choom gang he was tokin on some weak product by todays standards at least thats what one former congressman says after obama told the new yorker that marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol which opened the door to a broader conversation about legalizing or decriminalizing a drug thats on the federal governments most restrictive list schedule i former rep patrick kennedy dri said the president needs to brush up on his pot knowledge i think the president needs to speak to his national institute of health director in charge of drug abuse said kennedy who chairs smart approaches to marijuana a group that opposes legalization the nih director would tell the president that in fact todays modern genetically modified marijuana has much higher thc levels far surpassing the marijuana that the president acknowledges smoking when he was a young person obamas exploits as a potsmoking adolescent are well documented in his own memoir dreams from my father more recently in journalist david maraniss biography barack obama the story readers learned that obama as a high schooler in the late 1970s rolled with a group called the choom gang friends from hawaii who frequently got high sign up for politifact texts but has marijuana changed that much we decided to investigate what is thc cannabis contains roughly 500 compounds 70 of which are psychoactive thc or delta9tetrahydrocannabinol is the main psychoactive ingredient in the marijuana plant the level of thc in a plant varies based on the strain when researchers discuss the potency of marijuana they typically are measuring the concentration of thc thc levels also differ depending on the part of the plant used and how it is processed for consumption in addition to marijuana there are materials such as sinsemilla the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants hashish or cannabis resin and hash oil a concentrated extract from cannabis plants hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of thc than marijuana or even sinsemilla both of these have become more popular in recent years but what about marijuana itself has weed as we once knew it become more potent the answer is yes thc levels are on the rise and they have been for quite some time the university of mississippi potency monitoring project analyzed tens of thousands of marijuana samples confiscated by state and federal law enforcement agencies since 1972 the average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 34 percent in 1993 to about 88 percent in 2008 potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 58 percent to 134 percent during that same time period back in the late 1970s when obama was in high school he graduated in 1979 the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent said mahmoud elsohly director of marijuana research at ole miss further the number of samples confiscated with a thc concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly from 32 percent in 1993 to 215 percent of the 1635 marijuana samples collected in 2007 but while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher thc count the high mark in potency somewhere around 2527 percent remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isnt likely to increase elsohly said how did it get so strong the former congressman said the reason for the increasing levels of thc is genetic modification thats not quite right genetic modification or genetic engineering involves altering a substances dna at the molecular level producers of marijuana on the illicit market dont have the ability to pull off those kinds of labbased modifications however genetic selection involves breeding marijuana plants with the highest concentration of thc genetic selection unlike genetic modification has been practiced for centuries think about how we got different breeds of dogs or varieties of tomatoes genetic selection is quite prevalent in marijuana elsohly said drug dealers have steered toward these methods in hopes of creating a product that enables them to sell smaller volume at a higher cost cultivation methods that allow growers to control climate water and soil levels have dramatically improved production as well he said and they have a better idea what parts of the plant produce the highest concentration of thc there is some genetic engineering of marijuana in labs but its not widespread yet and its not the cause for the increase elsohly said what does it mean what does this rise in potency mean in a practical sense lets start with what the national institutes of health says since kennedy singled out the government agency noting that the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana has increased in recent decades the nih warns that daily use can have stronger effects on a developing teen brain than it did 10 or 20 years ago researchers have warned against marijuana use by teens and even young adults noting that developing brains have an increased risk of dependency that was an issue even before potency factored in though the growing strength of the drug does have health officials more concerned those concerns are also directed at populations who had already been advised against smoking marijuana when thc levels were lower such as individuals with cardiovascular diseases or those with certain mental illness such as schizophrenia but for the average adult recreational or habitual user theres a lot less certainty about what rising thc levels mean only a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying thc levels several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower thc level in that regard thc would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content people tend to drink whiskey in shots wine by the glass and beer by the mug marijuana may work the same way said carl hart a psychology professor at columbia university who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs roger roffman a social work professor at the university of washington and author of the upcoming book marijuana nation noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today especially in products like hash oil meaning we dont know everything about its potential impact beyond dependency health officials also warn that smoking marijuana can cause paranoia and in some cases anxiety attacks hospital visits caused by marijuana are on the rise over the last decade from 359795 in 2004 to 540340 in 2011 however it is unclear if that is caused by higher potency levels greater usage of marijuana or other factors this is all important food for thought because the debate is ongoing and more research is needed however this didnt affect our ruling our ruling kennedy said that marijuana today is genetically modified with thc levels that far surpass the marijuana of the 1970s generally speaking the potency of marijuana has been on the rise since obamas youth though experts disagree about what impact that rise could have on marijuanas negative health effects in part because the research so far has been incomplete the most offbase part of kennedys claim is that the rise in thc levels comes from genetic modification its actually from genetic selection a very old process of producing desired traits from crops on balance we rate his statement mostly true

politifact429,1,focus action march 2008 action update what does it take to be the most liberal member of the united states senate farther left than ted kennedy john kerry or even hillary clinton dear friend what does it take to be the most liberal member of the united states senate farther left than ted kennedy john kerry or even hillary clinton for the answer take a look at a man who could be the next president of the united states barack obama sen obama was recently named the most liberal us senator based on the annual voting analysis by the nonpartisan and highly respected national journal1 if he emerges as the democratic nominee one of the critical jobs of focus action will be to uncover the real barack obamanot the feelgood orator who speaks of change and hope but the man who would be the most leftwing president in our nations history and well need your continued help to do so obama as extreme as they come on family issues on abortion obamas 100 percent lifetime voting record from planned parenthood and naral only begins to tell the story2 while in the illinois state senate six years ago obama was the only senator to speak against the born alive infant protection act which protects babies who are born alive after a failed abortion in other words it prevents flatout infanticide a year later while the us senate was passing born alive 980 state sen obama quietly killed an identical bill in the state committee he chaired 3 not surprisingly then he also opposes the ban on partialbirth abortion 4 5 and supports allowing minor girls to be transported across state lines for abortions without parental notice or consent 6 and supports allowing minor girls to be transported across state lines for abortions without parental notice or consent perhaps most chilling is his avowed support for the freedom of choice act 7 which if signed into law would threaten every prolife law passed at the state and federal levels over the past 30 years which if signed into law would threaten every prolife law passed at the state and federal levels over the past 30 years in addition while the next president could effectively overturn roe v wade with the right supreme court appointments obama is proudly committed to appointing judges who will uphold legal abortion8 in fact his judicial philosophy is typical of the radical left he believes that judges can change the meaning of the constitution at their discretion9 not surprisingly he voted against the nominations of justices john roberts and samuel alito how about marriage and the homosexual agenda first he opposes the federal defense of marriage act doma 10 if given the chance by the liberal congress obama will overturn doma potentially forcing every state to recognize homosexual marriages and guaranteeing that you and i pay federal benefits to support homosexual couples please note technically he says he is opposed to samesex marriage but by standing against doma he is standing against the only thing that prevents samesex marriages from spreading state to state if given the chance by the liberal congress obama will overturn doma potentially forcing every state to recognize homosexual marriages and guaranteeing that you and i pay federal benefits to support homosexual couples please note technically he says he is opposed to samesex marriage but by standing against doma he is standing against the only thing that prevents samesex marriages from spreading state to state second he has pledged to homosexual leaders that he will sign the employment nondiscrimination act 11 forcing businesses to defend themselves against discrimination lawsuits should they not hire a particular candidate who then announces he or she is homosexual or transsexual he also supports hatecrimes expansion potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality forcing businesses to defend themselves against discrimination lawsuits should they not hire a particular candidate who then announces he or she is homosexual or transsexual he also supports hatecrimes expansion potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality then theres his support for teaching schoolchildren in 2nd grade no less about homosexual relationships12 he also wants to require women to register for the draft13 and as a state senator he even refused to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship14 the price of change hold on to your wallet sen obama talks constantly about the need for change but what he doesnt tell you is the price tag so allow me it will be very expensive change he supports raising taxes to pay for universal health care his free college program and a host of other government expansions15 among his pet projects is a bill he sponsored called the global poverty act which would commit the us to spending 07 percent of gross national product on foreign aid over 13 years that will amount to a whopping 845 billion increase over current foreignaid spending16 get your checkbooks ready national security one area where sen obama seems to have an aversion to spending is the war on terror but its not just the admittedly controversial war in iraq where obama has shown himself to be soft on terror he has repeatedly voted against funding our troops in iraqunless the funding included a date certain by which our soldiers must withdraw from their fight against al qaeda 17 even with the troop surge producing superb results obama has called both the surge and the war a failure 18 19 in fact he and hillary seem to be in a rhetorical contest to see who can abandon the battlefield first even with the troop surge producing superb results obama has called both the surge and the war a failure in fact he and hillary seem to be in a rhetorical contest to see who can abandon the battlefield first he along with hillary voted to give captured terrorists and illegal immigrants constitutional rights that are reserved for american citizens 20 can you believe that sen obama actually favors granting citizenship to illegal immigrants convicted of crimes against children aggravated felonies and other serious crimes 21 its true can you believe that sen obama actually favors granting citizenship to illegal immigrants convicted of crimes against children aggravated felonies and other serious crimes its true perhaps then it should come as no surprise that obama also voted against a resolution proposing a constitutional amendment to protect the american flag from desecration22 one has to ask did he learn anything from 911 ditto for hillary on most of the issues ive mentioned hillary isnt far behind obamas extremism in fact she ranked as the 16th most liberal senator in national journals scoring23 but the reality is that most people know about hillary they remember her push for governmentrun health care24 they know of her radical proabortion stance25 they may even recall her support for allowing young children to sue their parents26 obama though is the new kid on the block in fact a little more than three years ago he was still an illinois state senator now the media is fawning over him and isnt about to delve into his leftist record thats why focus actionwith your helpneeds to sound the alarm whoever the democrat nominee is the truth about their stands needs to be told in clear bold colors and of course the pros and cons of the republican candidate need to be laid out as well focus action is blessed to have some great channels to communicate the truth to the american public from radio programs to mailings to webcasts to advertisements of all sorts we have the vehicles to get the word out but your gifts are needed to provide the fuel to make those vehicles runso we can inform millions of voters not just in the presidential race but in the critical contests for house and senate as well throughout our history

gossipcop-898791,1,every aca pun in the pitch perfect movies pitch perfect 2 photo universal pictures the trailer for the third and final ill believe when i see it installment in the pitch perfect franchise has finally arrived and with it immense waves of pitch perfect nostalgia isnt it wonderful to be alive at a time when a pitch perfect franchise is a real thing according to that new trailer pitch perfect 3 promises more of what weve all come to expect from the pitch perfect movies organized nerd singing mashups of songs we didnt know we needed but now cant live without hello wake me up and zombie and of course the inexplicable but always adorable use of aca as a prefix in honor of this beloved acatradition vulture has gone ahead and made a list of all the plays on aca and pitch in the franchise thus far no this is not a joke were dixie chick serious pitch perfect the seminal movie about college students making sweet sweet music with their mouths and the bonds of sisterhood overcoming any obstacle even when that obstacle is a gorgeous solo from ben platt the original pitch perfect introduces us to the world of competitive collegiate a cappella singing through anna kendricks beca a freshman who pretty much hates everything and is honestly a real bitch until she meets the barden bellas and learns that singing covers and having a solid group of lady friends is good for the soul she also learns thanks to anna camps aubrey that a cappella is very serious and to show that seriousness a person should use aca as a prefix or pitch in a punny way whenever possible acascuse me theres nothing like the first time is there this is acaenthusiast aubrey to beca after beca makes fun of a cappella during the activities fair it is laced with as much attitude as you imagine my fellow acapeople we will not let egotistical bigheaded garbage dirtballs whoever you may be get in our way i promise you we will return to the iccas and finish what we started last year its time to be honest pitches aubrey is the best character in the pitch perfect franchise and she never gets the recognition she deserves dont acaat me well well well look whos in treble this isnt aca or pitch related but of all the puns the treblemakers get out of their group name this one used on initiation night is the best its worth it for adam devines line reading alone bumper is the worst but also kind of the best right ladies welcome to acainitiation night aubrey has things to do and covers of songs to arrange she cannot waste the syllables on a cappella initiation night this usage is simply about brevity youre one of those a cappella girls im one of those a cappella boys and were gonna have acachildren its inevitable slow your roll jesse the way to any college girls heart is not to immediately talk about having children aca or not hands in acabitches aubrey to the bellas for their first group huddle aca is a very versatile prefix used here as a term of endearment i know you have a toner for jesse ah yes the moment in which we all learned that toner is the term for a musical boner and also learned that musical boner is a thing i guess never tell me pitch perfect isnt educational i think were gonna be acaawesome chloe is the yin to aubreys yang and when aubrey is freaking out about how unprepared the bellas are for their gig at the sigma beta theta fall mixer chloe knows to talk her friend off the ledge via use of her favorite prefix of course they go on to bomb the sigma beta theta fall mixer but that is neither here nor there also them being so bad gives us one of the greatest lines in the movie this makes my beer taste bad acascuse me yup its your girl aubrey back with her standard reply to anyone who threatens her a cappella way of life this time its after chloe suggests that beca may be onto something when she complains about the bellas never trying anything new beca is right but there are more tactful ways to go about it so yes chloe and beca acascuse you the sockapellas proving that it doesnt get better for everyone after high school acascuse me acabelieve it heres the sitch the bellas are on their way to the icca semifinals but run out of gas because fat amy forgot to fill the tank after being attacked by a burrito at the hands of her true love bumper aubrey has every right to acascuse her teammate and honestly i dont appreciate fat amys tone here is she making light of the aca prefix you guys are gonna get pitchslapped so hard your man boobs are gonna concave heres fat amy with a great burn for bumper after he teases the team over their dated semifinals set list for a movie called pitch perfect they do not use pitch wordplay nearly enough it fits into so many phrases pitchplease acahuddle now this is of course aubrey signaling to us that acahuddles are way more serious than normal huddles the acagods have looked down on us and they have given us a second chance i wish aubrey would go more into detail as to who these acagods are once she receives news that the bellas have won a spot at nationals thanks to a technicality are the acagods pentatonix acaawkward yes fat amy it is acaawkward when aubrey tells her bff chloe to get her head out of her ass because its not a hat in front of the whole group excellent word choice shut your eyes and get rid of all the acapolitics john and gail are back at nationals and they really know how to set the scene am i the only one who cries throughout the entire bella finale performance listen up acaballers your final aca fix of the film comes courtesy of christopher mintzplasse the saddest audition coordinator there ever was let this dude sing let him live pitch perfect 2 pitch perfect 2 doubles down on the fat amy jokes but surprisingly not so much on the aca wordplay the sequel sees our girls prepare for and then of course win the a cappella world championships the bellas main competition this goaround comes from das sound machine a german a cappella group full of superhumans who are no doubt better than all of us at everything pitch perfect 2 also features a very cute subplot about benji falling for the newest bella emily hailee steinfeld and reminds us that no one would hate it if the pitch perfect franchise was about the power of lady friendship first then benjis revenge second the aca prefix is used sparingly but for the most part in much more creative ways than in the first film they dont blow their acawad all at once lets talkapella everyones favorite a cappella commentators gail and john are back and this time with a podcast called lets talkapella honestly thats a great name how has it not been taken before surely there must be people clamoring for an a cappellabased podcast right those deutschbags fat amy uses this clever wordplay to cut to the core of the bellas german nemeses moments before she praises the musical legacy of david hasselhoff so dont go thinking fat amy has a vendetta against all germans its just this one very specific very goodlooking group of germans who want to crush her friends dreams of making music with their mouths omacag baby bella emily fits right in with her new a cappella sisters she is also a complete weirdo acawiedersehen bitches one of the best running gags of pitch perfect 2 is that anna kendricks beca is completely smitten with the leaders of das sound machine even when she wants to be angry she attempts to aca her way out of a confrontation with her enemiescrushes and although she gets props for acaing in a second language this does nothing to help the bellas cause you are such a disaacapointment green bay packers offensive tackle david bakhtiari says this to teammate clay matthews after matthews blanks during the country song round in an underground a cappella league riffoff is that the greatest sentence ever written i almost burnt to death because of you acabitches after another disastrous performance cynthia rose knows theres nothing like a classic to really insult your friends classics are classics for a reason im not copenhating this place its not an acaword but as the bellas arrive in denmark for the a cappella world championships one has to wonder shouldnt this be copenhagens tourism slogan tonight groups from around the globe duke it out for the title of acaworld champions i mean this one seems pretty valid

gossipcop-929124,1,westworld season 2 episode 1 premiere recap spoilers for westworld season 2 episode 1 journey into night below westworld is back for round two which means the next several months will largely consist of you getting into arguments on reddit and feeling extremely uncomfortable about sophia the robots presence in your twitter feed but before we jump into season 2 episode 1 lets go over where we left off with the season 1 finale dolores shot dr ford at a party celebrating his final narrative said party was filled with delos employees whoops at the same time maeves robot rebellion beganand the man in black was shot in the arm maeve made what appears to be her first sentient decision opting to stay in the park to find her daughter teddy bernard and presumably the rest of the robots are in the nascent steps of selfrealization remember the order is memory improvisation consciousness a note about this episodes timeline the season 2 premiere seems to take place during two time periods the first is the present day it follows bernard hooking up with delos tech team features weird flashbacks that show dolores in modernday garb and ends with bernard admitting to killing all the hosts the second is two weeks prior in the immediate aftermath of the board gala massacre this is where the majority of the episode takes place real quick heres a sidebyside of bernards differing looks between two weeks ago and present day why he changed outfits is unclear but this is a helpful identifier if you ever find yourself confused about which bernard youre watching hbo left bernard two weeks ago right bernard present day without further ado lets get to the recap present day we learn westworlds location the westworld premiere begins with bernard wearing a gray suit lying on the beach surrounded by bodies based on the length the parks been offline its been about two weeks since maeve and dolores robot rebellion bernard appears disoriented and confused as hes carted off by stubbs hi stubbs long time no see and a very seriouslooking swat team to meet delos head of operations karl strand gustaf skarsgrd hes arguing about jurisdiction with a group of soldiers speaking chinese this implies that westworld is an island in asia which falls in line with a fascinating discovery a reddit user made in 2016 that westworlds finnish subtitles show the parks map coordinates and places it in the spratly islandsa disputed group of islands in the south china sea that are occupied by military forces from malaysia taiwan china the philippines and vietnam hboreddit coordinates found in the finnish westworld subtitles if westworld exists in this cluster of islands it stands to reason that the rest of delos parks do as well either way delos head of operations announces that there are search and rescue teams at the rest of the parks does this mean dolores and maeves rebellion has crossed park borders the appearance of a bengal tiger from park 6 towards the end of the episode certainly implies that borders have been breeched something weird is going on with the maze imprinted on the hosts scalps remember last season when the man in black discovered a maze drawing on the underside of kissys scalp hbo in this episode the maze drawing is discovered once again after technician antoine costa fares fares opens up a hosts head and while the man in the middle of the maze on both kissys head and this new hosts head both have their arms outstretched the man in the maze dolores discovers has one arm facing into his head hbo left the scalp from season 2 episode 1 right dolores maze toy im of the belief that nothing in westworld is an accident and the show wouldnt remind us of this whole scalpmazething if there wasnt a good reason is it possible that ford secretly placed this pattern on the hosts scalp and that once they achieve the bicameral mind one arm moves towards the brainindicating partial consciousness im not sure but pay attention to the nuances of this drawing going forward people tend to argue about it a lot on reddit so if youre interested in that fun time head over here we learn the hosts record video of everything turns out the hosts brains are essentially a baseballsized camera floating in a pool of fluid surrounded by metal we dont know much about how the system works just yet but we do learn the hosts are recording everything in the case of the host who gets scalped by delos tech the camera recorded footage of his deathbydolores who clearly isnt interested in saving her robot buddies and can be heard saying not all of us deserve to make it to the valley beyond hbo note is it possible that dolores is aware that repeat trauma is key to waking up the rest of her kind maybe shes just doing this dude a solid to get the process started bernard killed hundreds of hosts but why the last image of the episode is bernard and team delos standing by a previously nonexistent lake filled with the bodies of dead hostsincluding what appears to be teddy hbo bernard then announces he killed all the hosts this raises several questions the most obvious being how did that lake get there and why would bernard kill his fellow hosts my personal theory is that bernard hooked up with dolores at some point postfords death and she encouraged him to slaughter the hosts she didnt find worthy of reaching the valley beyond two weeks ago bernard discovers a secret delos underground lab a brief summary of bernards movements postfords death after a massacre of all their delos board buds he and charlotte hale manage to escape to a secret lab that bernard doesnt know about while there bernard suffers a near critical break but manages to save himself by injecting another hosts brain fluid into his neck bernard is wearing a black suit during these scenes some things to note 1 theres a new type of robot weve never met meet the drone host a faceless robot whose sole purpose seems to be extracting camera footage from hosts tracking human experiences in the park and stealing human dna this is apparently part of delos yettoberevealed master plan hbo the drone host doesnt seem to recognize bernard as a fellow host or a threat and furthermore the lab door recognizes his dna and allows him to enter we know bernard doesnt have human dna so im inclined to think ford rejiggered the system to allow bernard in and his infiltration of the lab is a part of fords new prewritten narrative and b a way for him to posthumously fck with delos 2 its clear bernard is malfunctioning but why last season felix lutz informed us that a bullet had damaged an important part of bernards robot brain and his leaking fluid certainly indicates a technical injury but my question isand please bear with me because this is somewhat complicatedhow far out into the future did ford program bernard or even his narrative as a whole what happens to a robot if the person secretly programming their every move dies did ford plan out bernards movements and decisions postrebellion and if not is it possible that since bernard isnt fully conscious yet hes finding it hard to function without a puppet master hbo 3 we learn the drone hosts are off networkso who is controlling them the hosts are largely being driven by fords new rebellion narrative but during this episode we learn the drone hosts are off network so are they currently the only hosts immune from said narrative id normally say yes but the fact that bernard was allowed into the laboratory makes me think fords reach has potentially extended to this area as well hbo 4 the mesh network could change everything while bernard helps charlotte track down abernathy more on him in a sec we discover the existence of a mesh networka subconscious link that allows hosts to contact and exchange information with each otherakin to ants communicating in a colony if there is a human vs robot war the fact that robots have what appears to be a hive mind definitely seems like a bonus we finally know whats up with abernathy wondering why delos took an entire two weeks to rescue everyone inside westworld because of one peter abernathy during charlotte and bernards time in the lab charlotte sends a distress call to delos who refuse to begin rescue procedures until they have a package that package abernathy whom you might recall hale and sizemore uploaded with years worth of delos data we havent caught up with abernathy as of yet but reddit has a fascinating theory that ford viewed him as a vessel he could upload his own personality into thus living on forever read more about that here dolores is on a killing spree and shes fully conscious dolores and teddy are now westworlds version of bonnie and clyde and from what i can tell they spent the immediate aftermath of fords death killing people dolores specifically spent a lot of time giving speeches about how conscious she is most significantly she muses ive evolved into something new and i have one last role to play myself giphy dolores also seems to be infatuated with a very confused teddy bless him and they share a romantic moment in which dolores casually announces her plan for world domination assuming this scene took place shortly after dolores killed ford its possible she and teddy will leave the park in future episodes more on that in a minute the man in black has a new game to play good news the man in black survived the host massacre and he meets and kills fords robotic child incarnation soon afterbut not before said child tells him to find the door as part of a new game honestly the man in blacks life seems exhausting but whats really relevant here is that child ford now has what appears to be the glitchy voice of adult ford indicating that westworlds genius mastermind found a way to live on forever after all maeve is back hectors alive and lee sizemore is the worst hbo maeves storyline is probably the most linear and easy to understand at this point in season 2 basically she makes her way back into the delos labs to discover everyones been slaughtered meets up with hector finds a very traumatized lee sizemore and they all set off to find maeves daughterwho still lives in the familyfriendly homestead area of the park thefuture maybe towards the beginning of the episode we see footage of bernard holding a rapidfire gun in the delos labs the same kind maeve and hector killed all the techs with and we also see dolores in a modernblack dress id argue that theyre maybe both flashforwards while its certainly possible that a this footage exists in the twoweek period between dolores rebellion and the delos swat teams arrival or b the footage of dolores takes place in the distant 35yearsago past i think its possible that westworld set up a new timeline for us the future we know the show loves itself a confusing and nonlinear narrative and references to the future were big during this episodeespecially during dolores speech to teddy when she says i see it all now so clearly the past the present the future i know how this story ends with us teddy hbo we also need to discuss the very first scene in the show which i initially assumed was a flashback to a circa 35yearsago conversation between arnold and dolores in which the former describes a dream about dolores water hosts hbo after watching the full episode it seems possible that arnold is potentially referencing what takes place later in the episode the death of multiple hosts in a body of water my theory this is actually a scene from the future between bernard and dolores who has been reprogramed to remember nothing

politifact13193,1,philando castile had been stopped 52 times by police minneapolis ap when philando castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot it wasnt unusual he had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the twin cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt he was assessed at least 6588 in fines and fees although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed court records show was castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops as several of his family members have alleged the answer may never be known but castiles stop for a broken tail light wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban st paul police officer and castiles girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath the shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling a day after castile died a black army veteran killed five officers in dallas at a demonstration over castiles killing and another fatal police shooting in louisiana the castile video is pretty horrific said gavin kearney who in 2003 coauthored a report to the minnesota legislature on racial profiling in the state there are things we dont know about it but we know there are certain assumptions and biases whether explicit or implicit about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions and we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over court records dating to 2002 show castile a 32yearold school cafeteria supervisor averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors many charges were dismissed but castile pleaded guilty to some mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance however those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed along with failing to wear a seat belt the records show no convictions for more serious crimes no recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in falcon heights the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred or in other minnesota towns minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data but in 2001 the legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to kearney then at the institute on race poverty at the university of minnesota law school to conduct it his study using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices overall officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites the analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas in fridley new hope plymouth sauk rapids and savage combined blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected the st anthony police department which employs the officer who shot castile did not participate in the study st anthony officials have not commented on castiles stop since shortly after the shooting it was not immediately clear how much money governments in the minneapolisst paul area generate from traffic violations a us department of justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of michael brown a black unarmed 18yearold in ferguson missouri found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks castiles girlfriend diamond reynolds a passenger in the car said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light she said one of the officers shot him for no apparent reason after he reached for his id valerie castile said she thinks her son was just black in the wrong place minnesota gov mark dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist the officer who shot castile jeronimo yanez is latino his lawyer thomas kelly said saturday that his client reacted to the fact that castile had a gun not his race though kelly would not discuss what led yanez to initiate the traffic stop police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped said darrel stephens executive director of the major cities chiefs association but the statistics cant simply be attributed to racial bias among police when people call the police they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime the police respond to those descriptions said stephens a former charlotte north carolina police chief that counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers last year the presidents task force on 21st century policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops searches and seizures nationally 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011 compared with 10 percent of the white drivers according to a survey by the us justice departments bureau of justice statistics the survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers the precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify said lorie fridell an associate professor of criminology at the university of south florida who trains police departments through a program called fair and impartial policing our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when were facing ambiguous situations fridell said a person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous if i as a white middleaged woman reach into my pocket most people arent going to experience fear for a black male with dreadlocks that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people

palpatines defeat rey adopts the name rey skywalker to honor her mentors11 development creation and casting in 2012 lucasfilm president kathleen kennedy invited michael arndt to write three screenplays for the star wars sequel trilogy intimidated by the scale of the project arndt at first turned down the offer he accepted the writing position however after kennedy explained that the films would tell the origin story of a female jedi12 the character rey was known as kira in the early stages of production and arndt described her as a loner hothead gearhead badass13 arndt struggled with introducing the young woman as the main character while keeping her from being overshadowed by luke skywalker whose role in the film was eventually minimized12 on creating a female lead for the

write rey as the central character and that other female representation in the story was also important6 kennedy stated that rey is the new generations luke skywalker14 reys background as a scavenger

her casting a secret for three months16 she was announced as part of the cast at the end of april 2014 she only had experience with small parts in tv shows her inexperience and lack of exposure were a crucial part of what convinced abrams to give ridley the role as the previous installments had featured relatively unknown talent that would not experience heightened degrees of scrutiny17 abrams stated that ridley was so funny and had a great spark as well as having her act out an emotional scene proclaiming that she nailed it on the first take abrams went on to praise ridley saying she was born with this gift to be in a moment and make it her own she simultaneously works from the inside out and the outside in18 kennedy proclaimed daisy had a physicality and a selfconfidence that was so important to the character we were looking for she epitomizes that optimism where anything is possible18 director dusan lazarevic who was present at the casting of ridley for a role in british drama series silent witness in addition to praising her acting range stated she showed a combination of vulnerability and strength which gave her a complexity and there was an intelligence in her eyes that was an indicator she could play quite a complicated part17 cailey fleming was additionally cast to portray a young rey1 although ridley said she was riddled with doubts and insecurities she said that reys hopefulness is what she related to most it was something driving me through the auditionseven though it felt so insanely out of anything that i couldve imagined19 ridley recalled her shooting experience as starting off bumpy with abrams telling her that her first few takes were wooden20 but ridley and abrams had an incredibly collaborative process creating rey ridley recalled that the character changed from when we first began she became softer and i think thats probably me because americans tend not to understand me so it helped slowing down the speech and everything just made it softer than i am19 ridley has said that rey will have some impact in a girl powery way adding that the character doesnt have to be one thing to embody a woman in a film it just so happens shes a woman but she transcends gender shes going to speak to men and women21 in an interview with elle ridley said shes so strong shes cool and smart and she can look after herself adding young girls can look at her and know that they can wear trousers if they want to that they dont have to show off their bodies18 composer john williams said he loved ridleys presence in the film and found composing her musical theme an interesting challenge he said her mature and thoughtful motif suggests a strong female adventurer infused with the force22 he added that the musical grammar of her theme is not heroic but conveys an adventurous tone that needs to illustrate empathy23 characterization rey is introduced as a 19yearold woman in the force awakens24 she is stubborn headstrong brave optimistic and maintains fierce loyalty to her friends matthew yglesias of vox wrote rey is considerably less callow than luke25 ridley says of the character its not because rey is strong that shes amazing its all the complexities of a human its because she is a welldrawn person who is struggling with things and youre with her26 rey is highly forcesensitive which is revealed when she is presented with the lightsaber first owned by anakin skywalker then his son luke27 without training she is able to use the force and defeat the powerful kylo ren in a duel28 on the mirrorinvoking vision rey experiences in the last jedi writer and director rian johnson said that it represents the character learning that she has to connect with herself29 in the last jedi rey also discovers she has a connection in the force with kylo ren in which rian johnson claims that it was used as a way to make rey engage with him and get the two characters to talk without fighting each other to further develop their relationship30 johnson explains that rey seeing kylo shirtless during one of these connections shows the increasing intimacy between them during their interactions30 in the rise of skywalker it is revealed that this connection makes them two halves of a dyad in the force and the cowriter of the film chris terrio explains this relationship as being sort of soulmates in the force31 and twins of fate twins of destiny both johnson and director jj abrams described their relationship as a romance30333435 appearances the force awakens rey is introduced in the 2015 film the force awakens as a

battlefront ii55 and lego star wars the skywalker saga56 the character was also introduced as an outfit in the game fortnite57 absence from merchandise when the force awakens was released fans noticed a lack of licensed toys featuring rey despite her being the films main protagonist58 for example hasbro released a version of monopoly based on the force awakens that did not feature rey after receiving criticism hasbro stated that rey was withheld to avoid revealing spoilers and that she would be featured in future toy releases59 paul southern the head of lucasfilm licensing said that they wanted to protect the secrets that the force awakens in rey and that her character carries a lightsaber60 he said that demand for rey products was underestimated6162 abrams said it was preposterous and wrong that rey was not wellrepresented in merchandizing8 the cbbc presenter and voice actor christopher johnson stated it still baffles me to this day that some toy manufacturers dont think that girls want to play with superhero toys and that boys arent interested in female characters63 reception general the character and ridleys portrayal have received critical acclaim joe morgenstern of the wall street journal proclaims that rey is a woman warrior with the stylish ferocity of a kungfu star praising the verve ridley must have been born with plus the skill she must have acquired as a young actress coming up in england and stating its hard to imagine what the movieand the sequels to comemight have been if theyd cast the wrong person but here daisy ridley is in all her unassuming glory and alls right with the galaxy64 adam howard of msnbc states that one of the most pleasant surprises of the film has been the strength of its lead female character adding that some have likened rey to a new feminist icon65 megan garber of the atlantic writes that rey proves herself to be in extremely short order extremely adept as a fighter66 emily rome of hitfix describes rey as more strong female character than strongly written saying the speed with which rey mastered jedi mind tricks and lightsaber fighting with zero training is the stuff of fan fiction rey is geek feminist wishfulfillment67 rome says rey is everything we wanted in a star wars female character praising her for being a character that is independent skilled scrappy tough and doesnt need saving67 twitter users have debated whether rey is a mary suean unrealistically perfect idealized characteron the basis of her seemingly natural skills as a mechanic a fighter a pilot and a user of the force which draw admiration from other characters68 screenwriter max landis posted a series of tweets in 2015 derisively referring to the force awakens as a fanfic movie with a mary sue as the main character6869 tasha robinson of the verge writes that rey keeps falling into standardissue damselindistress situations then capably rescuing herself shes a fantasy wishfulfillment character with outsized skills an inhuman reaction time and a clever answer to every question but so are the other major star wars heroes70 robinson suggests viewers enjoy reys mary sue flawlessness saying we wouldnt be worrying about reys excessive coolness if she were ray standardissue white male hero6870 other outlets including ridley herself have argued that the term mary sue carries an inherent gender bias71 and that the male characters from the original trilogy did not face comparable criticism72 media critic caroline framke argues that reys abilities are not necessarily any more impressive than those of the character of luke skywalker and that fans instinctive criticism of characters like rey reflects a double standard in that seemingly perfect male heroes are rarely so criticized68 j j abrams stated that the people who are getting freaked out are the people who are accustomed to male privilege and this is not oppression this is about fairness he elaborated you can probably look at the first star wars movie that george lucas did and say that leia was too outspoken or she was too tough anyone who wants to find a problem with anything can find the problem the internet seems to be made for that73 adrienne tyler of screen rant argued that reys abilities are explained in the rise of skywalker as resulting from the pair forming a dyad in the force sharing the same fighting capabilities74 reys unique hairstyle attracted attention before and after the force awakens was released75 being compared to leias hairdo from the original film with debate over whether it would become as popular76 rey has also been compared to the titular character from the hayao miyazaki anime film nausica of the valley of the wind 198477 richard roeper described ridleys portrayal of rey as a breakout performance continuing by calling the character tough and resourceful and smart and brave78 ridley was nominated for a 2016 saturn award for best actress for her portrayal79 the first reel women in technology award for a fictional character was awarded to the character rey80 some fans criticized reys trilogywide character arc as insufficient fan fiction author ricca said that tension that was built in the first two films never gets resolved in the last film she wanted a moment at the end of the rise of skywalker in which rey reacts to and reflects on everything that has happened to her81 some critics and fans have noted a visual resemblance between reys character design to that of bastila shan from the video game star wars knights of the old republic and that her character arc shares thematic similarities with that of bastilas82838485 parentage the question of reys parentage was a significant point of discussion before the rise of skywalker was released8687 many fan theories arose such as rey being the daughter of luke or han or being obiwan kenobis granddaughter868889 the view that she is lukes daughter was especially prominent with fans and critics highlighting their story arc similarities star wars being a skywalker saga rey having a strong attachment to lukes lightsaber and being exceptionally strong with the force without any training888990 some fan theories about reys parentage pointed to reys theme featured in john williams score of the force awakens as the theme shared similarities with the themes for darth vader and luke91 abrams stated that he intentionally withheld reys last name and background in the force awakens92 he said that he felt that the origin of kylo ren was the only thing that could be revealed in his film and that he knew quite a bit about reys origin but would give courtesy to the last jedi director rian johnson by not saying any more9394 in the last jedi rey is coaxed by ren into admitting that her parents were nobodies emily vanderwerff of vox equated this scene with luke finding out that darth vader is his father which was his greatest nightmare95 to vanderwerff reys greatest nightmare is being no one she added that while ren has every reason to be lying about this to her mind it is a good thing that rey is the child of nobody of particular importance to the story so far95 josh spiegel of the hollywood reporter stated that although some fans might be disappointed by rens revelation it fits in perfectly with the films through line that one can be both exceptionally gifted in the force and also not a skywalker because the spirit of the jedi extends to anyone with a gift and the power to believe96 before the release of the rise of skywalker abrams said that theres more to the story than youve seen97 though according to ridley the facts presented in the last jedi would not change98 rey being revealed as a palpatine in the rise of skywalker received a mixed reception joanna robinson of vanity fair interprets the twist as a rebuttal to the themes presented in episode viii calling it a blow to those fans who eagerly devoured rian johnsons message that anyone from anywhere can be a forcewielding hero99 contrarily ryan britt of fatherly wrote that the revelation may be resonant for those with a dark sideinclined family because rey decides not to play palpatines stupid game and when palpatines face melts off and the dark side disappears into the ether a lot of emotional family bullshit goes with it100 inverse similarly argued that the end of the film sees rey reject any power her grandfather held over her and bury the past in a completion of the heros journey101 following the release of the rise of skywalker daisy ridley revealed that the identity of reys parents had been in constant flux over the course of the production of the sequel trilogy according to ridley during early production lucasfilm had been toying with an obiwan connection before settling on the idea of her character being a nobody102 j j abrams then pitched the idea of palpatine being reys grandfather to ridley during preproduction on episode ix although this aspect of her character kept changing even into production102 james hunt of screen rant argued that the idea of an obiwan connection wouldve been an equally bad decision because it would still mean the character is powerful because of her lineage rather than rey simply being powerful because the force chose her it would have continued the focus on nostalgia and trying to connect everything rather than letting rey be wholly new103 kathleen kennedy later clarified that there were a lot of ideas being thrown around but that obiwan having offspring was pretty much off the table104 see also notes references further reading

politifact11855,1,chinas space threat how missiles could target us satellites at 528 pm est on jan 11 2007 a satellite arced over southern china it was smalljust 6 ft longa tiny object in the heavens steadily bleeping its location to ground stations below just as it had every day for the past seven years and then it was gone transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft it was not the start of the worlds first war in space but it could have been it was just a test the satellite was a defunct chinese weather spacecraft and the country that destroyed it was china according to reports a mobile launcher at the songlin test facility near xichang in sichuan province lofted a multistage solidfuel missile topped with a kinetic kill vehicle traveling nearly 18000 mph the kill vehicle intercepted the sat andboomobliterated it it was almost just a deadreckoning flight with little control over the intercept path says phillip s clark an independent british authority who has written widely on the chinese and russian space programs for china a nation that has already sent humans into space and developed intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms the technology involved in the test was hardly remarkable but as a demonstration of a rising military posture it was a surprisingly aggressive act especially since china has long pushed for an international treaty banning space weapons the move was a dangerous step toward the abyss of weaponizing space says theresa hitchens director of the center for defense information an independent defense research group in washington dc china held the moral high ground about space and that test reenergized the china hawks in congress if were not careful space could become the new wild west you dont just go and blow things up there in fact after the chinese test india publicly stepped up its development of antisatellite technology and some israeli officials have argued that given chinas record of selling missile technology to iran israel should develop its own program international threat for many countries the most disturbing aspect of the test was not the potentially destabilizing sat kill but the resulting debris which poses a serious threat to every satellite in orbit as well as to the international space station space debris is a huge problem says laura grego staff scientist in the global security program at the union of concerned scientists a 1centimeter object is very hard to track but can do considerable damage if it collides with any spacecraft at a high rate of speed think of a shotgun pellet traveling at 10 times the speed of a bullet smashing into a device built to be as light as possible and then consider that chinas antisatellite asat test produced as many as 35000 of these pellets or pieces of debris in the 1cm range nearly 1500 pieces were 10 cm and larger although the united states knew that china was planning to test asat technology administration officialsreluctant to disclose the level of us surveillancechose to say nothing china failed two or three times before successfully launching the missile in january all the attempts were observed by the us air force satellite system known as the defense support program infrared telescopes on these 33fthigh defense satellites can spot the plumes from rockets launched anywhere on earth battlefield space media platforms design team 1 songlin test facility near xichang sichuan province china publicly available satellite images of the facility were censored by china prior to the test immediately following they were declassified 2 experts believe a fourstage solidfuel launch vehiclethought by american officials to be based on chinas kt2boosted the kill vehicle into orbit 3 the fengyun 1c target vehicle was launched may 10 1999 with a twoyear active life span the 1650pound polarorbiting weather satellite was equipped with two 10band scanning radiometers for earth observation 4 the kineticenergy kill vehicle was traveling nearly 18000 mph when it struck the satellite 5 the collision blasted debris throughout low earth orbit within 7 hours a band of debris had spread halfway around the globe some details of chinas asat test are classified our artist relied on published reports declassified information and comparable technology to create this graphic the chinese kinetic kill vehicle is based on raytheons exoatmospheric kill vehicle diagram by golden section graphics inset satellite photograph by digital globe media platforms design team americas own sat kills every industrialized country relies on satellites every day for everything from computer networking technology to telecommunications navigation weather prediction television and radio this makes satellites especially vulnerable targets imagine the us military suddenly without guidance for its soldiers and weapons systems and its civilians without storm warnings or telephones some satellites however are at greater risk than others most spacecraft including spy sats are in low earth orbit which stretches 1240 miles into space as the chinese test proved such targets could be hit with mediumrange missiles tipped with crude kill devices gps satellites are far higher orbiting at about 12600 miles many communications sats are in the 22000mile range destroying them requires a much more powerful and sophisticated longrange ballistic missile yet it can be done youd need a skysweeping capability to comprehensively negate a space support system that is scattered all over says john pike a space analyst at globalsecurityorg youd need icbmsize boosters hundreds of them such an allout satellite war would render space useless for decades to come thered be so much debris up there clark says that it wouldnt be safe to put anything up in space the united states and russia the two countries with proven asat capabilities have long steered clear of satellites as military targets even during the cold war spy sats were handsoff the consequences of destroying them were greater than those of unwelcome surveillance the consensus clark says was that anybody could look at anybody else media platforms design team diagram chinas antisatellite strike took place at an altitude of 537 miles which places the international spacecraft depicted below well within range of chinas space arsenal nevertheless the us military has spent decades designing weapons capable of killing other countries satellites the crudest american asat test codenamed starfish prime took place in 1962 when the us air force detonated a 14megaton nuclear weapon at an altitude of 250 miles the explosion which occurred about 800 miles west of hawaii disabled at least six us and foreign satellites roughly a third of the worlds low earth orbit total the resulting electromagnetic pulse knocked out 300 streetlights in oahu clearly nukes worked as asat weapons but far too indiscriminately to develop a more surgical capability the air force launched project mudflap which was designed to destroy individual soviet satellites with missiles but inaccurate spaceguidance systems plagued early tests then on may 23 1963 the air force pulled off a successful intercept with a modified nikezeus ballistic missile launched from kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands it took out a rendezvous and docking target for nasas gemini missions at an altitude of 150 miles over the next several decades the air force graduated to more sophisticated airlaunched missiles that could hit targets with far better accuracy in 1985 the united states destroyed an american solar observation satellite using a threestage heatseeking miniature vehicle fired from an f15 fighter jet that test like the chinese one earlier this year used a kinetic kill vehicle that spewed debris into space funding for the program was cancelled before the airlaunched system could be perfected that same year at the white sands missile range in new mexico the air force began operating the powerful midinfrared chemical laser in 1997 it was used to temporarily blind sensors on an air force missilelaunch and tracking satellite the sat remained intact no debris was created and no laser tests have been conducted since however the current federal budget includes funding for a laser to be fired at a low earth orbit sat from the starfire optical range at kirtland air force base in new mexico later this year some 400 million has been spent in recent years to develop another sophisticated kill vehicle a threestage missile that smacks an enemys craft with a sheet of mylar plastic disabling it without producing any debris it has yet to be fully tested and would only work on satellites in low earth orbit communication and gps sats are too high destroying an adversarys satellites has farreaching implications do you take out only military sats or socalled civilian ones too nearly every satellite has dual uses a civilian weather satellite used for tracking hurricanes also could watch military movements many satellites are used by multiple nations and once a nation disables an adversarys satellites it puts its own in peril as charles vick a senior analyst at globalsecurity says its an act of war us sat kill arsenal davin coburn 1 perhaps the most spectacular test known as starfish prime occurred on july 9 1962 when a 14megaton nuclear warhead was detonated 250 miles above the pacific radiation and electromagnetic pulses disabled at least six satellites and created an eerie artificial glow for 20 minutes 2 the us conducted its only direct antisat test in 1985 when an f15 climbed to 80000 ft then fired a threestage missile it caught up to a 17500mph solwind solar observation satellite at an altitude of nearly 300 miles over vandenberg air force base in california 3 in 1997 the us army hovertested a kinetic energy weapon that could act like a spaceage fly swatter the kill vehicle extends a mylar sheet to disable satellites without destroying them the military found the technology too messy and eventually canceled the program 4 the xss11 microsatellite isnt an antisat but it could be first launched in april 2005 the spacecraft is designed to circumnavigate targets and relay diagnostic data some experts note that it wouldnt be difficult to reprogram the craft to ram into enemy targets media platforms design team sending a message so why did china risk provoking international hostility the countrys government has been opaque the experiment is not targeted at any other country said a foreign ministry spokeswoman in beijing some experts think at least part of chinas motivation lies in an unclassified 2006 us report on the future of military activities in space the document reaffirms that the united states considers space capabilities vital to its national interests consistent with this policy the united states will preserve its rights capabilities and freedom of action in space dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so and deny if necessary adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to us national interests the united states basically said it has the right to restrict the use of space to only its allies clark says adds jeffrey g lewis an arms control expert at the new america foundation much of the world was appalled at the tone of the policy one british newspaper columnist basically said it made space the 51st state in that context some experts say the chinese test was an effort to force the issue to show the united states the potential consequences of refusing to negotiate a favorable treaty on the military use of space the us was restricting all these arms treaties says michael ohanlon a senior fellow in security studies at the brookings institution a washington dc think tank for the chinese the test was an effort to deal from a position of strength pike believes china may have another rationale for flexing its space muscle taiwan china has long yearned to reabsorb the breakaway island state which the united states has pledged to defend in the short term pike says china has only two strategies that could lead to a taiwan takeover it could bluff the us in a nuclear confrontation or it could try something altogether different fire mediumrange missiles from mobile launchers just as it did in the january test and take out americas lowflying imaging satellites doing so might blind us military planners long enough for chinese military forces to gain a foothold on the island the chinese stage these big amphibious exercises off taiwan all the time one day maybe itll be real pike says either the us will get there quickly enough to stop them or the chinese will win the race and there wont be the american political resolve to kick them out all the chinese would need is time a halfdozen sats pike says thats all it would take those satellites are lowhanging fruit its a nobrainer in that scenario the asat test was not really about china showing the united states its capability it was about china confirming that its own war plan is feasible americas trump card the longterm ramifications of the test will take years to play out but for now few observers think china scored any gains it was a mistake ohanlon says it fueled american hardliners who want to restrict american technological cooperation with china and it doesnt help chinas case saying it isnt a threatening military power vick says it is a threat and the test showed that whether the united states suddenly accelerates its asat capability beyond the testing phase remains to be seen the country is in the midst of a war budgets are already tight russia is not perceived as a threat and china has only 60 satellites few of these are worth shooting down americas most robust asat weapons were not designed for destroying satellites at all they are missiles developed and operated by the missile defense agency mda formerly known as the strategic defense initiative all us ballistic missiles are actually dualuse and while their ability to shoot down incoming rockets has been proven only in tests it would be easy to direct them against any low earth orbit satellite twentyfour mda missiles are operational in alaska and california far more than would be needed pike says to handle any immediate asat needs there is he says just nothing to shoot at for now that is the militarization of space has long been debated with one blownup old weather satellite china has made the prospect of a new arms race far more likely it showed the world that it is willing to go toetotoe up in the final frontier waste mismanagement impact one day it takes only 24 hours for debris to spread along the destroyed satellites sunsynchronous polar orbit the force of the impact drives debris into higher and lower orbits but most of the wreckage remains at the satellites original altitude july 2007 the debris ring broadens and begins to mix with satellites and the abundant trash in low earth orbit which extends to an altitude of about 1240 miles january 2008 a year after the test the debris field continues to spread joining the cloud of general space junk which includes everything from 10ton rocket boosters to radioactive droplets of sodium potassium coolant from the nuclear cores of soviet satellites its called the kessler syndrome the point at which low earth orbit becomes so crowded with debris that collisions render space unusable debris accumulates over time and takes decades to decay says dr ts kelso of the center for space standards and innovation we cant track the smaller pieces so there is even more out there than we know the graphic at left illustrates the density of

gossipcop-1716370499,0,fifty shades of dakota 15 things people dont know about dakota johnson 30 shares share on facebook pint it email dakota johnson most of us know her as the actress from fifty shades of grey while we may have seen johnson in some pretty intimate positions onscreen theres definitely a lot we dont know about the fifty shades star like for instance the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree seeing that her popular movie fifty shades darker came out on the day of lovevalentines dayits only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint anastasia steele johnson after all has become somewhat something of a valentines day staple herself here are 15 facts about dakota johnson or as some might call her that girl from fifty shades of grey we guarantee that she will no longer by that girl by the end of the list 15 her family tree is full of famous faces you know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree well we werent lying her parents are fellow actors melanie griffith and don johnson unfortunately her parents divorced in 1994 so dakota had to split her time between the two it was the only way that i could be with them she said in an interview for cosmopolitan and since they were divorced i would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other traveling with a tutor but wait it gets better her maternal grandmother can you guess is hitchcock actress tippi hedren yes thats right so clearly creative talent lies in that family weve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind now dakota johnson is another famous name in that tree 14 shes an animal rights activist just like her grandmother tippi hedren dakota johnson is also an animal rights activist like grandmother like granddaughter shall we say as animal lovers ourselves were pleased to hear that shes following in her grandmothers footstepsboth in acting and in animal rights in 2014 johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them what a sweet thing to do we bet her grandmother was really proud its always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things so naturally were happy to hear of dakotas compassionate side we admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers but who doesnt we always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and its always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better 13 she grew up shooting guns and riding horses in colorado she may play the innocent and naive anastasia steele in the fifty shades movies but growing up johnson was anything but naive she grew up in colorado at her dads house where she learned to build a fire ride a horse ride motorbikes and even shoot a gun and this was all before she was just 10 years old sounds like a badass kid to us but when she wasnt at her fathers house she was at her moms house in la which she also loved its hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns riding motorbikes or building fires without being grounded but it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more 12 she never dates by the header we mean she never has casual relationships she only has longterm relationships good for her is all we can say you hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities you can barely keep up with who theyre dating these days it seems to be one guy or girl after another so its great to hear of dakotas conservative views on relationships apparently shes only ever been in longterm serious relationships she doesnt just date that probably explains why shes been in a relationship with model matthew hitt since 2014 yes its been a kind of an onandoff relationship but theyve been in it for the long haul so far so to sum up we like her whole dating attitude the commitment is great and saves you a lot of time 11 she hated school it seems like we have something in common with dakota johnson a loathing of school okay so maybe not all of you hated school many of you probably loved school or at least thrived at school but most of us can say with the utmost certainty that we hated school with a passion we all have our reasons why johnson for instance hated school because she felt like an alien she said she didnt understand the process of school as a child and felt suffocated i dont know about you guys but i can totally relate with dakota on this many of us felt like we didnt really fit in at school so its especially comforting to hear that a big name like dakota johnson also felt like a social outcast in class like many of us she preferred hanging out with her friends than going to school but hey we admire her honesty 10 auditioning gives her panic attacks we have a very natural easy way with each other now we both really needed each other through this process jamie on dakota dakotajohnson anastasiasteele christiangrey fiftyshadesdarker jamiedornan a post shared by fifty shades darker fiftyshadesen on feb 13 2017 at 317pm pst watching the pristinelooking alist celebrities gliding around the golden globes award ceremony is enough to wreck your mind with selfdoubt over their unbelievably high levels of confidence and self esteem if only we could possess as much poise the truth is many of these celebrities dont feel that way at all confident and self assured that is dakota johnson for example gets so nervous during auditions that she often has panic attacks and were not just talking a bit of breathlessness here and there were talking fullon panic attacksthe real deal so before you come to your conclusions that the celebrities you see on television and in magazines are way more confident than youll ever be just remember something every single one of them suffers from selfdoubt at one point or another it happens to all of us 9 she doesnt have facebook nowadays it seems like virtually every celebrity has his or her own facebook page that youre able to like in order to keep up with whatever is going on in their lives even the likes of beyonc and adele have their own facebook pages dakota johnson on the other hand doesnt follow suit while there are facebook fan pages of the actress dakota johnson doesnt have her own personal page so if you thought you had found her you were misguided because this woman seriously doesnt have facebook why according to johnson i was on facebook until i caught myself being a psycho stalker thats when i chose to stop we can all agree with that cmon at one point or another who hasnt stumbled upon an exs facebook page and stumbled into even more random pages were with ya dakota 8 she used to be a model black mass will have a screening at venice film festival on september 4th dakotajohnson a post shared by dakota johnson officialdakotajohnson on jul 24 2015 at 1236pm pdt when dakota johnson left school you know that place she hated she signed with img models for your information img models has also signed with the likes of gigi hadid bella hadid taylor marie hill karlie kloss miranda kerr lily aldridge and a host of other famous models most of us are happy if we can bag a job at burger king upon leaving school but lets be honest wed kill to get signed with a modeling agency like img damn the absence of prominent cheekbones and killerlong legs but hey were happy for the girl a little envious sure but still very happy for her johnson has also starred in other modelling campaigns like the mango jeans line its no wonder she got picked for the leading role in fifty shades shes quite a stunner 7 she was only nine when she made her first film debut the fifty shades of grey movie made dakota johnson the wellknown name she is today sure some of us have watched her in films before but we probably werent so familiar with exactly who she was now were kind of obsessed so we thought wed let you know that johnson has actually been playing in movie roles for quite a while now and it stems back to her childhood thats right she was a child actor if you couldnt tell from her talented bloodline crazy in alabama was dakota johnsons first film debut which she did when she was just nine years old she and her halfsister played the role of the daughters to their actual mother melanie griffith and even more interesting the movie was actually directed by antonio banderas their stepfather 6 she never used a body double in fifty shades of grey one word pretty much defines dakota johnson brave yes shes brave alright not only has she starred in one of hollywoods most erotic and controversial movies shes also bared her entire body to the world she never used a body double in the fifty shades of grey movie that was all her every curve every inch all dakota it takes guts to do that it really does the only scene that required a body double was in one bdsm scene it was used during a scene in which anastasia gets whipped with a belt johnson refused to participate in the scene because she didnt want her body getting marked which we cant entirely blame her forother than that every other scene was completely her 5 she had to have all her tattoos covered for her role as anastasia steele well it kind of makes sense can you honestly imagine a tattooplastered anastasia steele hmm it doesnt really fit does it since she wasnt using a body double dakota johnson had to have her tattoos covered to play the role of anastasia steele in fifty shades of grey and the same rule applied for the sequel fifty shades darker she admits her tattoos can be a real pain in the acting world i went through a phase where i loved tattoos and i loved the feeling of getting tattooed she said but now ive outgrown them mostly and because i always have to cover them for jobs god theyre annoying seeing as she has many tattoos you can imagine how much time it must take to cover them all up 4 her favorite book is lolita dakota johnson must have a thing for controversial stories because her favorite book is lolita by vladimir nabokov if you dont already know the story its about an older mans love and obsession with a 14yearold girl lolita its a classic novel but also as we said before kind of controversial however there are a lot of important themes within this book which is essentially what makes it the classic novel that it is today interestingly enough not only is it johnsons favorite book but her mother actually also played lolitas mother in the film adaption of lolita in 1997 who knows if her mothers role in the movie has anything to do with dakotas love for the book maybe it does but nevertheless its an incredibly powerful book even if it is a little on the strange side 3 she always carries three specific things in her purse you will find all sorts of things in a womans handbag a womans handbag is her pride and joy we take pretty much everything necessary in our handbags okay an unnecessary too you never know when you might need your ipad maybe thats why theyre getting larger and larger we also have specific items that we always carry with us in our purse it might be one specific object thats always in there or maybe two for dakota johnson there are three items she can never be without in her purse keys candy and chapstick keys yes they are definitely an essential to keep in your purse thats kind of obvious candy well its definitely a smart idea who doesnt love snacking on candy throughout the day and chapstick yes another essential no respectable woman wants to be seen with cracked lips 2 she beat out a number of hollywood actresses to land the role of anastasia steele a quien elegis bella kristenstewart bellaswan crepusculo twilight a post shared by magalib misseriesfav on feb 14 2017 at 450am pst who can forget the initial craze of the fifty shades franchise it was insane everybody was literally obsessed with the book series and when we heard there was going to be a movie it got us all asking the same question who would play anastasia steele obviously everybody also wondered who would play the role of christian grey but right now were focusing on dakota johnson and as she played anastasia it feels only right to talk about that now anyway dakota johnson reportedly beat out a host of wellknown hollywood actresses including kristen stewart elizabeth olsen shailene woodley alicia vikander lucy hale imogen poots and chloe bridges to land the role of anastasia in the 2015 movie fifty shades of grey she was one lucky and envied girl 1 her and jamie dornan do get along in spite of rumors you know how the press can be like they tend to sensationalize pretty much every tiny detail they get hold of sometimes they completely fabricate stories from nothing at all well this happened with the fifty shades of grey costars it was reported that dakota johnson and her costar jamie dornan did not get along the press made us believe that these two hated each others guts but in actual fact they get along well despite what the press say they are friends theyre on good terms and if you seen her acceptance speech when she won the peoples choice award for favorite dramatic movie actress thanking him and saying she couldnt have done it without him you would know that there is anything but hatred and bitterness between these two

and matt duffer the creators and showrunners of the series stranger things was created by matt and ross duffer known professionally as the duffer brothers29 who also serve as showrunners and head writers and direct many of the episodes they wrote and produced their 2015 film hidden in which they emulated the style of m night shyamalan however due to changes at warner bros its distributor it did not see wide release and the duffers were unsure of their future30 to their surprise television producer donald de line approached them impressed with hiddens script and offered them the opportunity to work on episodes of wayward pines with shyamalan the brothers were mentored by shyamalan during the episodes production so that when they finished they felt they were ready to produce their own television series31 the duffers prepared a scriptwhen similar to the series eventual pilot episode along with a 20page pitch book to help shop the series to networks32 they pitched the story to about 1533 cable networks all of whom felt a plot with children as leading characters wouldnt work and asked the brothers to either make it a childrens series or drop the children and focus on hoppers investigation into the paranormal31 in early 2015 dan cohen the vp of 21 laps entertainment brought the script to his colleague shawn levy they subsequently invited the duffer brothers to their office and purchased the rights for the series giving the brothers full authorship after reading the pilot the streaming service netflix purchased the whole season for an undisclosed sum34 and in april of the same year the series was announced for a 2016 release35 the duffer brothers stated that at the time they pitched to netflix the company had already been recognized for its original programming in shows such as house of cards and orange is the new black with wellrecognized producers behind them and were ready to start giving upcoming producers like them a chance32 the brothers started casting and brought levy and cohen in as the other executive producers to discuss storylines with levy also directing for the show36 montauk is an eighthour scifi horror epic set in long island in 1980 and inspired by the supernatural classics of that era we explore the crossroads where the ordinary meet the extraordinaryemotional cinematic and rooted in character montauk is a love letter to the golden age of steven spielberg and stephen king a marriage of human drama and supernatural fear the duffer brothers original pitch for montauk 37 the book cover the duffer brothers created to pitch montauk for this they took inspiration from stephen king book covers such as firestarter the series was originally known as montauk the setting was then montauk new york and nearby long island locations montauk figured into a number of real world conspiracy theories involving secret government experiments3538 the brothers had chosen montauk as it had further spielberg ties with the film jaws where montauk was used for the fictional setting of amity island39 after deciding to change the narrative of the series to take place in the fictional town of hawkins instead the brothers felt they could now do things to the town such as placing it under quarantine that they really could not envision with a real location39 with the change in location they had to come up with a new title for the series under direction from netflixs ted sarandos so that they could start marketing it to the public the brothers started by using a copy of stephen kings firestarter novel to consider the titles font and appearance and came up with a long list of potential alternatives stranger things came about as it sounded similar to another king novel needful things though matt noted they still had a lot of heated arguments over this final title40 to pitch the series the duffer brothers showcased images footage and music from classic 1970s and 1980s films such as et the extraterrestrial close encounters of the third kind poltergeist hellraiser stand by me firestarter a nightmare on elm street and jaws in order to establish the tone of the series37 writing the idea of stranger things started with how the brothers felt they could take the concept of the 2013 film prisoners detailing the moral struggles a father goes through when his daughter is kidnapped and expand it out over eight or so hours in a serialized television approach as they focused on the missing child aspect of the story they wanted to introduce the idea of childlike sensibilities they could offer and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans the brothers thought the combination of these things was the best thing ever31 to introduce this monster into the narrative they considered bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the cold war such as project mkultra which gave a way to ground the monsters existence in science rather than something spiritual this also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period as it was a year before the film red dawn came out which focused on cold war paranoia31 subsequently they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s the decade in which they were born as elements of the series3141 crafting it in the realm of science fiction and horror42 other influences cited by the duffer brothers include stephen king novels films produced by steven spielberg john carpenter david lynch wes craven43444546 and guillermo del toro40 films such as star wars alien and stand by me404447 japanese anime such as akira and elfen lied4043 and several video games including silent hill dark souls and the last of us484943 the duffer brothers believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally including beyond the black rainbow and daryl discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the series39 several websites and publications have found other pop culture references in the series particularly references to 1980s pop culture50515253 the main villain for the last seasons was inspired by the villains that scared the brothers when they watched the movies and miniseries as children freddy krueger pinhead and pennywise54 with netflix as the platform the duffer brothers were not limited to a typical 22episode format opting for the eightepisode approach they had been concerned that a 22episode season on broadcast television would be difficult to tell a cinematic story with that many episodes eight episodes allowed them to give time to characterization in addition to narrative development if they had less time available they would have had to remain committed to telling a horror film as soon as the monster was introduced and abandon the characterization32 within the eight episodes the brothers aimed to make the first season feel like a big movie with all the major plot lines completed so that the audience feels satisfied but left enough unresolved to indicate theres a bigger mythology and theres a lot of dangling threads at the end something that could be explored in further seasons if netflix opted to create more55 regarding writing for the children characters of the series the duffer brothers considered themselves as outcasts from other students while in high school and thus found it easy to write for mike and his friends and particularly for barb40 joyce was fashioned after richard dreyfuss character roy neary in close encounters of the third kind as she appears absolutely bonkers to everyone else as she tries to find will56 casting the duffer brothers cast david harbour as chief hopper believing this was his opportunity to portray a lead character in june 2015 it was announced that winona ryder and david harbour had joined the series as joyce and as the unnamed chief of police respectively16 ryders sole condition to the duffers in accepting the part was that if a beetlejuice sequel ever materialized as she and tim burton had been discussing since 2000 they had to let her take a break to shoot it a condition the duffers agreed and ultimately proved to work out when beetlejuice beetlejuice was greenlighted57 the brothers casting director carmen cuba had suggested ryder for the role of joyce which the two were immediately drawn to because of her predominance in the films of the 1980s31 levy believed ryder could wretch up the emotional urgency and yet find layers and nuance and different sides of joyce ryder praised that the shows multiple storylines required her to act for joyce as if shes out of her mind but shes actually kind of onto something and that the producers had faith she could pull off the difficult role58 the duffer brothers had been interested in harbour before who until stranger things primarily had smaller roles as villainous characters and they felt that he had been waiting too long for this opportunity to play a lead while harbour himself was thrilled by the script and the chance to play a broken flawed antihero character4059 additional casting followed two months later with finn wolfhard as mike millie bobby brown in an undisclosed role gaten matarazzo as dustin caleb mclaughlin as lucas natalia dyer as nancy and charlie heaton as jonathan17 in september 2015 cara buono joined the cast as karen18 followed by matthew modine as martin brenner a month later19 additional cast who recur include noah schnapp as will1722 shannon purser as barbara barb holland60 joe keery as steve harrington2322 and ross partridge as lonnie61 among others actors auditioning for the children roles read lines from stand by me31 the duffer brothers estimated they went through about a thousand different child actors for the roles they noted that wolfhard was already a movie buff of the films from the 1980s period and easily filled the role while they found matarazzos audition to be much more authentic than most of the other audition tapes and selected him after a single viewing of his audition tape32 as casting was started immediately after netflix greenlit the show and prior to the scripts being fully completed this allowed some of the actors takes on the roles to reflect into the script the casting of the young actors for will and his friends had been done just after the first script was completed and subsequent scripts incorporated aspects from these actors55 the brothers said modine provided significant input on the character of dr brenner whom they had not really fleshed out before as they considered him the hardest character to write for given his limited appearances within the narrative56 filming the brothers had desired to film the series around the long island area to match the initial montauk concept however with filming scheduled to take place in november 2015 it was difficult to shoot in long island in the cold weather and the production started scouting locations in and around the atlanta georgia area the brothers who grew up in north carolina found many places that reminded them of their own childhoods in that area and felt the area would work well with the narrative shift to the fictional town of hawkins indiana39 the filming of the first season began in november 2015 and was extensively done in atlanta georgia with the duffer brothers and levy handling the direction of individual episodes62 jackson served as the basis of the fictional town of hawkins indiana6364 other shooting locations included the georgia mental health institute as the hawkins national laboratory site bellwood quarry and patrick henry high school in stockbridge georgia for the middle and high school scenes65 emory universitys continuing education department the former city hall in douglasville georgia the georgia international horse park in conyers georgia the probate court in butts county georgia old east point library and east point first baptist church in east point georgia fayetteville georgia stone mountain park palmetto georgia and winston georgia66clarification needed set work was done at screen gem studios in atlanta66 and the series was filmed with a red dragon camera56 filming for the first season concluded in early 201663 after the third season finished filming producers considered the idea of keeping the starcourt mall set as a permanent attraction for fans to visit but ultimately decided against it67 the fourth season of stranger things was expected to consist of eight episodes with the first episode titled chapter one the hellfire club68 filming for the season was slated to begin in january 2020 and to last through august69 with the release of a february 2020 teaser for the fourth season the duffers confirmed that production had started70 some filming for the fourth season took place at lukiks prison and nearby in vilnius lithuania71 in march 2020 production was stopped due to the covid19 pandemic72 production resumed in september 202073 filming of the fifth season of stranger things was expected to start filming in june 2023 according to david harbour74 the duffer brothers stated over twitter that the 2023 writers guild of america strike has delayed filming for the fifth and final season75 production began on january 8 2024 and wrapped on december 2076 visual effects to create the aged effect for the series a film grain was added over the footage which was captured by scanning in film stock from the 1980s56 the duffer brothers wanted to scare the audience but not to necessarily make the series violent or gory following in line with how the 1980s amblin entertainment films drove the creation of the pg13 movie rating they said such films were much more about mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore though they were not afraid to push into more scary elements particularly towards the end of the first season56 the brothers had wanted to avoid any computergenerated effects for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with practical effects so they created an animatronic to play the part of the demogorgon7778 however the sixmonth filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots they went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could but for other shots such as when the monster bursts through a wall they opted to use digital effects postproduction on the first season was completed the week before it was released to netflix31 the title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the stranger things title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title the sequence was created by the studio imaginary forces formerly part of rga led by creative director michelle doughtey79 levy introduced the studio to the duffer brothers who explained their vision of the 1980sinspired series which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted later but prior to filming the producers sent imaginary forces the pilot script the synthheavy background music for the titles as well as the various book covers from king and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery and were looking for a similar approach for the series titles primarily using a typographical sequence80 they took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by richard greenberg under rga such as altered states and the dead zone they also got input from dan perri who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films various iterations included having letters vanish to reflect the missing theme of the series and having letters cast shadows on others alluding to the mysteries before settling into the sliding letters the studio began working on the title sequence before filming and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input80 initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used closeups of the best features of these fonts but near the end the producers wanted to work with itc benguiat requiring them to rework those shots the final sequence is fully computer generated but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects such as using kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software the individual episode title cards used a fly through approach similar to the film bullitt which the producers had suggested to the studio80 music michael stein and kyle dixon of the electronic band survive have composed the original soundtrack for the show including the shows theme song81 it makes extensive use of synthesizers in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including jeanmichel jarre tangerine dream vangelis goblin john carpenter giorgio moroder and fabio frizzi82 according to stein and dixon the duffer brothers had been fans of survives music since the 2014 film the guest818384 once the series was greenlit the duffer brothers contacted survive around july 2015 to ask if they were still doing music the two

testimony from witnesses presented before it by fbi investigators andor us attorneys on july 7th the report continues a massive explosion occurred that obliterated a twostory house the shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away as per standard protocol and procedures this report details svr analysts in their replying to the mods request for information about this event conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion carole paladino age 72 and her husband john paladino age 73with and very surprisingly to them a svr database target hit on carole paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by svr analysts as being a probable witness against the clinton foundation now deceased carole paladino was the lead school nurse for millville public schools located in cumberland county new jerseyand whose inclusion in the svrs database of potential witnesses against the clinton foundation was due to her being a central identified and named figure in the creation of a document titled training protocols for the emergency administration of epinephrine for the new jersey department of education epinephrine also called adrenaline this report explains is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxisthat is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause deathand whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine autoinjector epipenand that the carole paladino collaborated on report for its emergency administration led new jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their state both public and private to purchase itand their passing another law allowing new jersey school nurses to also use epipens without parental permission whether knowingly or not knowingly carole paladino by her being a main target person in the plot to force all new jersey schools to purchase epipens she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in us historythat began when the american global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company mylan nv suddenly began funneling money to the clinton foundationand that nearly immediately after which saw gayle conelly manchin take over as the head of the national association of state boards of educationand who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged states to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight lifethreatening allergic reactionsthat in turn helped pave the way for mylan nv maker of epipens to develop a near monopoly in school nurses offices throughout the united stateswith new jersey is one of the 11 states drafting laws requiring epinephrine autoinjectors be bought by schoolsand that the obamaclinton regime conspired with using their epipen law that gave funding preference to states that did what gayle conelly manchin told them to do unbeknownst to the american people this report notes is that gayle conelly manchin is the mother of heather breschwho in 2012 right after her mother took control of the national association of state boards of education and began her campaign to force schools to buy epipensbecame the ceo of epipen maker mylan nvwith heather bresch upon taking control raising the price of epipens over 400 to 600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over 27 millionand whose protection for this vile plot was provided by her father and gayle conelly manchins husband democratic party us senator joe manchin to an even greater scandalcatastrophe awaiting hillary clinton as it dwarfs too near insignificance her epipen one this report further notes is her active and knowing participation in the united states opioid crisisthat the centers for disease control and prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the us have increased by 133 percent from august 2016 to august 2017 and now total 67344 deaths per yearnearly all of which were deliberately caused by oxycontinmaker purdue pharmawho after funneling tensofmillions of dollars to the clinton foundation saw the obamaclinton regime to a blind eye to their flooding of america with opioidsand as exampled by democratic party us senator joe manchins home state of west virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills that roughly equals 433 pills for every man woman and child in his state this report after describing the horrific opioid crisis in america concludes with svr analysts noting that this past week also provided an explanation as to why the fbi task force investigating hillary clinton and her clinton foundation has been increasing their electronic communications with the united states attorneys office for the eastern district of tennesseeand that is due to a shocking court case currently underway in knoxville tennesseethat was brought against the clinton foundation bribed pharmaceutical giant purdue pharma by tennessee attorney general herbert h slatery iii on behalf of the citizens of his stateand whose shocking to the conscious just released by order of the court documents stunningly reveal purdues own records show company founders and executives pressed its sales team to push tennessee doctors to prescribe deadly dosages of oxycontin on a longterm basis while lying to doctors about the dangers purdue leaders lied to the medical community politicians and the public not only about the dangers of oxycontin but created a false narrative that longterm use of opioids didnt create addicts but instead caused pseudo addictive symptoms the groups sought to convince the public they had a right to opioids tennessees legislature was pushed by one of those advocacy groups to pass a law requiring doctors to prescribe opioids if a patient insisted purdue also used fake advocacy literature such as pamphlets videos and social media to convince the public that longterm use of opioids led to a higher quality of life the firm sent doctors fake literature with similar claims but added material on how oxycontin purdues financial rainmaker was better for patients than other opioids on the market img srchttpsmedia8chnetfilestoreb4a605f160e4e0f03903a232c185067ff24b83dd8a1f8b361f2be3dfc83dbdb3jpeg

gossipcop-4562409654,0,the matrix empires 1999 keanu reeves interview just before the birth of the 21st century keanu reeves carrieanne moss and laurence fishburne made history slipping on the shades of neo trinity and morpheus in a film that very few saw coming with audiences focused on the imminent return of star wars the wachowskis dropped a bombshell clad in black leather the vibrations of which are still being felt nearly two decades later back in the carefree spring of 1999 empire sent packed a freshfaced journalist off to la where he sat down with the star of speed to chat about his little scifi project public perception and rumours that he had secretly married david geffen the following article first ran in the july 1999 issue of empire keanu reeves is the world would have you believe dumb enquire as to the precise extent of his dumbness and the world will no doubt come back to you with references to pairings of diminutive lumber and the viscosity of porcine excrement cracks may also be made about his exotic name translating as cool wind whistling between the ears and speculation will be had as to synaptic tumbleweed rolling lazily between his dendrites still in any doubt lets survey the evidence reeves made his movie debut in 1986 in rivers edge a bleak and pessimistic tale of disenfranchised teens which rapidly gained cult status before redefining youth culture with alex winter in two bill and ted movies the pervasive influence of which would have california surfspeak dominating the teen argot from kidderminster to karachi dude for his next trick he took on the bard in kenneth branaghs much ado about nothing and apparently was one of the reasons the movie got made nervous studio execs noting that branaghs interpretation had a naked keanu five pages in and reasoned that this might offset your average 13yearold girls allergy to iambic pentameter he then played hamlet on stage in canada much to the worlds barely stifled guffaws and once hed got over first night nerves i wasnt acting i was surviving he remarked of the debut the critics who bothered to stay around actually praised his performance then he turned up in a little sleeper called speed oh and when director jan de bont asked keanu if hed like to reteam with sandra bullock for a sequel to one of the most successful action movies of all time reeves took a quick look at the script and politely declined opting instead to tour europe with his universally agreed to be average folk thrash band dogstar leaving jason patric to board the big boat movie this summer hes continuing the successful trend with the wachowskis the matrix a midbudget scifi spectacular which rocketed to number one in the american box office swiftly redefined the way the future looks and raised reeves asking price per movie to 15 million if this is dumb then empire will be first in line for a prefrontal lobotomy keanu reeves is slumped on a sofa in a slightly poky suite in los angeles four seasons hotel looking mildly knackered hes just off the blower to some farflung publication as part of the press round for the matrix he is empire can attest as irritatingly goodlooking in real life as he is on the screen today hes dressed head to foot in black with a slightly distressed vnecked tshirt completing the ensemble after an odd little dance after which empire winds up slumped on the sofa and reeves in the chair opposite and after the tape recorder has been positioned exactly to his liking we enquires as to whether he had any idea while he was shooting that this was going to be a big hit erm pause no pause i didnt oh can you ever tell no one knows pause no one can tell pause anything can you tell when youre making a stinker no pause but you can feel that you are but it doesnt mean that it will be pause those feelings are pause stronger the problem with keanu reeves perversely is not that hes dumb but that hes very bright what he lacks as with the many stars who have dropped out of high school is the means to express himself the result is either aeons of pausing while he searches for the right expression or the now trademark keanuspeak when he just whips away the verbiage filters and ejects whatever happens to be in his head at the time and hopes that some of it is relevant there will be a fair measure of this today in the matrix keanu plays thomas neo anderson a computer hacker who comes to realise that the world is fake a computer program designed to fool human beings who are in fact being farmed as living duracells by the artificially intelligent machines that took over the planet years ago having been extracted from the matrix by a band of renegades led by laurence fishburne anderson proceeds to learn to beat the program at its own game developing superhuman powers when within the matrix quite literally the ability to leap tall buildings at a single bound while being pursued by matrixgenerated bad guys the result is something like a philosophical debate on the nature of reality with kung fu and guns lots of guns but it wasnt the blistering action that attracted reeves it was the script he remembers the writing first of all the way that the characters speak and what they say i loved the dialogue and the ideas in the piece i was really struck by the storytelling they screenwritersdirectors the wachowski siblings found a way in a kind of linear journey to tell a nonlinear story it wasnt what i call a climbing a mountain thing you know he gestures towards an imaginary himalaya just beyond the coffee table and adopts a pompous voice theres the mountain and were going to climb the mountain and then we have the trials of climbing the mountain i said im tired and i just want to do chekhov and they said you can do chekhov when youre older intellectual crampons aside there is still a fair amount of action you know guns huge explosions helicopters hurtling into glass sided buildings and erupting into walls of flame that sort of malarkey the film is i think character and storyoriented he disagrees thats why they wanted the actors to do the fight sequences so they could pull the camera back and you could always have a sense of place and in terms of the story something is being acted out so i never really looked at it as an action movie apart from some of the gun stuff in the government lobby an astounding sequence in which neo marches through a lobby blowing people away while dressed in a trenchcoat maybe wed better not go there but thats exciting too he concedes i love the tension after five hours of setting a shot up and then getting one go at it i kinda like that its terrifying but its also exciting it was the wachowskis determination that they would be able to pull the camera back during action scenes that led to the key cast spending a full four months training in kung fu and wirefighting a hong kong cinema technique in which during fight sequences the actors are suspended from wires and flung about the place in a manner that mere muscle power or the hollywood stunt standbys of trampolines and airrams simply cant provide it was a period in which any of the actors could have fitted in another movie instead they spent every day at a specially designed training centre being hoisted around like so many living marionettes the training was one of the things i had to consider he says of his decision to do the film i said im tired and i just want to do chekhov and they said you can do chekhov when youre older uncle vanya therefore put on ice for the time being reeves headed out to australia for a shoot where the cast rumour has it spent as much time in casualty as in front of the camera yeah people got hurt he nods when asked about the productions expenditure on bandaid and nurofen it was hes pulled this hes pulled that smashed this smashed that but we didnt break any noses for some reason we were all really good at not hitting each other or at least we saved it for the shoot i know laurence and hugo had to punch their fists together agent smith is fighting morpheus in the bathroom and they punch its how did they they just had to do it reeves would also find himself enjoying the wirefighting its great he enthuses that fall where i jump from the building that was like a 35foot wirejump they just had some guys and a machine dropping me upside down i got good enough to do the front flip and the back flip and the run up the wall and i got to do one of the spins so i really enjoyed it but i dont know he ponders in an odd way that was the easy part its finding the interior of the character thats the challenge it raises an interesting hardy perennial of a question namely can keanu actually act opinion is as they say divided on the matter many audiences even those composed of diehard fans would be forced to admit that reeves delivers the same irresistibly charming goofoff persona whether hes essaying don john or jack traven much like marilyn monroe cary grant and jimmy stewart reeves is film star rather than character actor and theres nothing wrong with that after all character actors are ten a penny whereas your authentic movie star is a much rarer and more precious breed directors and fellow thesps though tell a different story after much ado about nothing kenneth branagh said of him hes a brave resilient actor who takes the knocks and plaudits with equal grace as a result he just gets better and better mind you kenneth branagh also said id pay money to see keanu reeves in leather trousers and i think a lot of other people would as well which may give a clearer insight into the casting motivation to say nothing of the wardrobe decisions other actors who have worked with him attest to his dedication and talent almost to a thesp the result is that reeves career has taken a hiply eclectic route with lowbudget independent though he hates the phrase movies presumably to prove his acting chops alternating with the bigbudget summer popcorn fare so is there a plan at work here there are no plans he protests seemingly genuinely appalled by the idea i find plans you can have a wish or a desire or a want or a hope its a desire in me to play in different genres and different scales of movies but isnt it the case that the more success you have the more you become perceived as a film star so the less easy it is to take parts in smaller films erm very long pause i guess people make that delineation he admits uncomfortably you certainly can get that expectation from people i love working in hollywood especially if its a film i respond to i loved acting in devils advocate but also a film like the last time i committed suicide a blackandwhite indie about the beats in which reeves delivers a creditable though unmistakably keanu performance as beat hero neal cassidys permanently pissed best mate so i want to be able to work in both of those but havent the popcorn flicks of late been less than intellectually challenging dumb even yeah he agrees theres starting to be a sameness about them i feel but im sure that thats always the case the more i read about old hollywood the more im like thats happening now you know ive had friends who work in independents who say well weve got this great script but they want us to get an actor first bellows hello you know thats happening all the time now but anyway he peters out did i answer your question goofy grin im sorry i started daydreaming you know when you start to think of something and then you think of all these other things but er what was your question if keanu is slightly wary of being labelled film star the worlds tabloid press has had no problem at all with the concept and reeves has been the ungrateful recipient of some of their wilder speculation empire approaches the next question with caution is dealing with the media getting easier pause specifically how did you react to the press saying that youre dumb oh right right pause empire decides to up the ante slightly and that youre gay and you got married to david geffen oh what do i say to that pause erm reeves settles into deep thought what do i say to that he mutters again to himself i dont know how to answer this well yeah i guess i deal with whatevers coming at me in terms of geffen well rumour itself is odd so is gossip so for me its as if it exists in another universe that doesnt have much to do with me and when you have to visit that universe thats what you deal with as opposed to the work im doing its am i gay or am i dumb it must get boring its not boring he laughs i dont know its just one is really personal well theyre both personal questions which dont have anything to do with why youre there and so i guess its bad taste to more tasteful matters then what pray is occupying reeves spare time these days even this area of questioning generates the now familiar periods of dead air pause hanging out with friends spending time with my family looking for work taking a lot of meetings he says before remembering something else and brightening im in a band he announces were making a record this will be the infamous dogstar combo in which keanu plays bass and has in the past attracted mixed reviews reeves himself having declared that he is pretty much inept on the bass in one interview i have no rhythm and has an unusually eclectic fanbase composed mainly of nondiscriminating folk thrash fans and keanyboppers desperate to get a brief eyeful of their shaggy haired object of lust does it bother him that hes the main draw at dogstar gigs i dont know he muses you know what i hope i hope that if they come to see me because they saw me in a film and liked the work so they want to come to the freakshow that they like the music you know thats not so bad its a treat that awaits thousands of brits this year as the band will be playing glastonbury for the first time any worries i love playing festivals he enthuses just please dont throw any hard objects empire informs him that mud is more likely to be the problem thats fine he grins muds fine i dont mind mud im usedto that why keanu should be particularly used to mud must remain a mystery for theres no time to find out one final question does he have any regrets any movie that if he had a delete button hed wipe from the record keanu pauses no he smiles id keep them all even the paula abdul video pause cool for cats an interview with laurence fishburne laurence fishburne hes the man that explains the matrix given that he is just two hours from curtain up on the lion in winter in which fishburne is currently wowing broadway as the king of england and given too that fishburne is in the company of albions finest movie magazine the imposing actor feels dutifully obliged to state the debt he owes to the greats of british thespianism peter otoole richard burton michael caine sean connery lan holm he lists all of these cats theyre just he thinks for second bad motherfuckers man though there is a keen sense of humour lurking beneath the brooding exterior it is fair to say that nobody does mean and moody better than fishburne and since declaring several years ago that he was to cease being hailed by the flippant moniker larry laurence fishburne fish to his mates has employed his talents to such effect in films like the cotton club king of new york deep cover boyz n the hood othello and not least the matrix which has provided him perhaps surprisingly with his biggest commercial hit to date i mean we all knew we were making something really extraordinary but that doesnt necessarily mean that anyones going to get it he says reflecting on his role as morpheus a sort of lord of dreams whose function aside from coolly lurking in the dark wearing sunglasses seems to be to explain what the hell is going on the wonderful thing about the film is that it does several things at one time he ventures it introduces you to this really amazing concept about alternate realities it deals with a great many spiritual teachings which have run through human consciousness for centuries and then it gives you this great sort of ride this great visual feast that you can get lost in if you want to shooting the matrix was not all laughs mind and despite fishburnes admiration for the wachowskis remarkable cats and costar reeves one of the most intelligent cats ive ever met he admits that the muchvaunted seven months of intense physical training plus the shoot in australia were rather taxing sadly his longtime ambition of mounting a jimi hendrix biopic having secured the rights to the book scuse me while i kiss the sky would seem to be fading now that at 37 he is ten years older than the axeman was when he bought the farm clocks ticking he says what would seem a safer bet is that at least one more matrix film will be in the works theres supposed to be a prequel and a sequel he explains i would love to be on board but im not assuming anything i can just tell you i would love nothing more there is really only one issue left after two hours of rollicking action and hyper kung fu fisticuffs did fishburnes sunglasses a tiny pair of specs clipped tentatively to the bridge of his nose really never fall off

gossipcop-873677,1,how bachelor contestants cash in after the show is over ashley rosenbaum and danielle lombard photo courtesy of instagramdaniellellombard courtesy of instagramashleylynnrosenbaum tonight the improbable 21st season of the bachelor comes to a close only one woman will walk away with everlasting love but all of the contestants will get the opportunity to reach for something greater free money related stories a history of the bachelor by the people who lived it whether they were sent home in the first few weeks or made it all the way to the final rose ceremony every contestant will enter the amorphous realitytvpersonalityslashsocialmediainfluencer economy which in 2017 is booming since contestants are not paid to appear on the bachelor the best chance to capitalize on their newfound visibility is right after the show the stars and contestants do not want to appear too thirsty for fame of course they went on the bachelor to find love but time is of the essence in a few months a new season of the show will premiere and there will be 25 new contestants for the public to follow the best brand partnerships are being negotiated right now and the only way for contestants to extend their time in the spotlight is to keep making deals and sharing their lives with the public so how much money can stars and contestants make and how exactly do they cash in we talked to a few members of the bachelor franchise to find out flat tummy tea and teeth whitening socialmedia endorsement deals with brands are some of the most popular ways contestants cash in on their fame instagram is the main platform for this likely because that is where bachelor stars tend to build the biggest following you know their faces not necessarily their names kaitlyn bristowe who served as the bachelorette in 2015 said she was bombarded with instagram offers as soon as she left the show happily in the arms of her fiance shawn booth overnight you have this huge following so all these brands are like here do you want to work with us she told me in a phone interview so you get offers to do the flat tummy tea and the teeth whitening and all that for somebody who has worked a regular job before youre like oh my gosh youre going to pay me to do that glorious kaitlyn chose to partner with brands like palm bay cocktails smartfood popcorn and tresemm these kinds of ads which have proliferated across social media over the last five years are pretty easy to spot they all feature slightly hamfisted product placement obviously prewritten captions and specific hashtags like volumerevolution tresemmepartner realitytv stars can reportedly make 1500 to 7000 for each simple photo depending on their follower count and bachelor and bachelorette leads are not the only ones to book these kinds of deals even contestants who were only briefly on the show can rack up multiple clients for example when the current bachelor nick viall sent contestant danielle lombard home just a few weeks into this season she immediately got to work since her departure from the show just five weeks ago she has posted advertisements for bootaybag panties weekend vice clothing bombay hair rose gold curling irons for those victoria secret voluminous waves diff sunglasses muddy body face masks glam seamless hair extensions fabfitfun subscription boxes away luggage drip doctors ondemand iv therapy for immunity and the jetsmarter app lucky for danielle she probably will not have to keep all those ads on her feed should she later regret posting them oftentimes brand contracts will stipulate that stars can delete the posts after a certain amount of time kaitlyn for her part said it takes time to find the right instagram ad balance i have turned down money to stay true to who i am and brands that i want to work with she explained to dance or not to dance with the stars one of the most coveted opportunities for a bachelor star is an appearance on abcs dancing with the stars it is added exposure and the celebrities on the show are paid well they reportedly make sixfigure base salaries and bonuses for every week they stay in the competition in the past three bachelors one bachelorette and one bachelor contestant have scored placement on the show and this season nick will join their ranks his announcement about joining the show however was met with controversy when news of nicks casting broke kaitlyn claimed on twitter that bachelor creator mike fleiss prevented her from doing dancing with the stars after her run as the bachelorette actually i was offered it had the contract mike fliess sic told me i wasnt allowed he said he didnt want people wanting fame after his show she tweeted actually i was offered it had the contract mike fliess told me i wasnt allowedhe said he didnt want people wanting fame after his show httpstconszricohi4 kaitlyn bristowe kaitlynbristowe february 27 2017 the bachelor creator did not comment on the accusation and instead responded on twitter kaitlynbristowe has my total support if she wants to appear on dwts thebachelor this did not pacify kaitlyn she pointed out that the opportunity was no longer available to her thanks ill get right on that opportunity 2 yrs ago i wonder what changed your mind she tweeted we reached out to representatives for fleiss for comment and will update if we hear back the controversy shows the fraught position bachelor and bachelorette stars find themselves in after the show they do not want to seem too famehungry they are supposed to be settling down with a fianc but if they do not aggressively pursue opportunities right away they risk losing out on cash chris soules a bachelor who appeared on dancing with the stars in 2015 said in a phone interview that bachelor producers have a say in almost everything you do afterwards because stars remain under contract for a year after the show he added that he was surprised to hear kaitlyns story i sort of knew that mike fleiss could approve or disapprove most anything but i just figured its abc theyre a pretty important company to mike fleiss so i just assumed that he was indifferent if the contestants went on kaitlyn told me she would still love to know why she was not allowed to dance with the stars but she has moved on im going to be starting my podcast soon and living in nashville ive been songwriting and singing so thats really fun she revealed she said she has recorded three songs and ultimately hopes to release an album televised weddings and couples therapy dancing with the stars is not the only realitytv option

interviewed jade and tanner at a marriage boot camp premiere last year they confirmed that they started filming the show just three months after their wedding they considered it a positive experience i guess you know we didnt look at it as a negative thing like our marriage is in trouble jade said were more like lets learn from these couples now so we dont have problems later because both of us come from divorced families we really want to get through everything together and so we just felt like why not weve done everything else on tv in a blog post after his season of the show aired in 2015 sean was more direct ill admit it i did it for the money he wrote both couples are still married so maybe it was worth it brandfriendly babies five married bachelor couples have stayed together long enough to have children and those babies have become part of the socialmediainfluencer economy too last year i met sean and catherine at a baby shower for their first child and the whole event was sponsored by dreft baby detergent like fellow bachelor parents jp and ashley sean and catherine have featured their baby in instagram ads for brands like hellofresh and teami blends tea desiree and chris siegfried who married after season nine of the bachelorette recently placed their son in an ad for pace salsa caption ad its ashers first taco tuesday jade and tanner meanwhile just became pregnant with their first child immediately after announcing the good news on instagram jade posted an ad for the ava fertility tracker which she credited for helping her get pregnant quickly these five couples represent a vast minority of bachelor and bachelorette stars who have managed to continue to make money for years after their appearances on the show by sharing more and more of their lives with the public families used to pass down farms or dental practices through the generations but now weve reached an age where realitytv stars are bequeathing socialmediainfluencer status to

husband and frequent costar javier bardem but this fall brings another wave of transformation her way she will be seen next month in murder on the orient express kenneth branaghs starstudded adaptation of the agatha christie novel as a missionary named pilar estravados cruz adds a spanish twist to the role ingrid bergman made famous in the books first film adaptation in 1974 a slew of

versace in what might be the most anticipated tv event of 2018 ryan murphys the assassination of gianni versace american crime story in anticipation of her next big moment cruz had an intimate phone conversation with a friend who has been there since the early days before she made history oscar winner gwyneth paltrow gwyneth paltrow i was trying to remember when we first met but im afraid i cant penlope cruz we had lunch at madeo in los angeles we were alone and talking about our deepest secrets as if we had known each other for 20 years it was around the time i was doing all the pretty horses 2000 paltrow wow weve been friends for a long time weve been through so much together cruz and even though we live so far away and dont spend nearly enough time together when i see you its like it was only yesterday paltrow i was thinking the other day about how you used to study dance was your goal to become a ballerina cruz thats what i wanted as a little girl by the time i went to ballet school at age 4 i was already asking to play the role of carmen i didnt realize then that the reason i liked dancing was because it was just another form of acting i was hardcore training something like five hours a day six days a week but when i did my first movie when i was around 17 i just fell in love with acting thats when i stopped dancing paltrow do you miss it cruz i miss the freedom i felt when i was dancing i remember it as some kind of trance i imagine singing is like that for you you have such an amazing voice paltrow its totally like that how did you get your first job cruz i got an agent when i was 15 and she sent me to a casting for jamn jamn 1992 and i got the job for both javier and i that was the movie that actually started both our careers paltrow you were 17 when you did that cruz i think i was but i was lying so much about my age that i cant be sure paltrow most actresses try to make themselves younger but you were making yourself older cruz ive spent most of my career trying to make myself older for different reasons journalists have been asking me since i was like 22 are you afraid of aging that is such a crazy question for a 22yearold girl or for that matter for a 42yearold i combat that craziness by refusing to answer the question paltrow its amazing hollywoods obsession with the aging of women and how much scrutiny we get for being whatever age we are cruz my mom worked very hard to raise us as did my dad without bullshit ive always had a real sense of rootedness in family and reality its not like im proud of the values i have because i dont feel like theyre up to methey just come from the way i was raised im rooted by the things ive seen in my mom the things i admire in her and in my father when it comes to talking about aging as an actress i feel like what the fuck im not going to give you even two minutes to honor your question it doesnt deserve that something changed when i gave birth to my daughter i started thinking come on its 2017 why do women still have to be talking about this its crazy that sense only got bigger when i had children paltrow of all my friends i think you love acting the most when you talk about something youre doing when youre preparing for something you have this enthusiasm and this passion that from my perspective has never waned speaking for myself i dont feel the same passion for it that i used to cruz its helped im happy to say that my ego has gotten smaller over time i used to be so afraid about what people were going to think of me if i was going to be accepted if i was going to be loved i put a lot of energy into the perception of myself when i became a motheralmost seven years agosomething very deep changed in me where i really dont care about a lot of the stuff i used to care about before thats part of growing up and now i have to go through other tests that life will put in front of me i have new fears now paltrow around the time i turned 40 i felt completely liberated from other peoples perceptions or expectations of me cruz i wouldnt for a second change the way i feel now for the way i felt in my twenties how i see the world how i look at actingeverything has changed it has in a way brought me back to the beginning when i was 4 and loving dancing loving getting in the skin of other characters and exploring the beauty of human behavior i get so much happiness from being a student again from exploring whatever happens with the result if ive had that process i feel like it has been something good that it has taught me something new if im 80 and i have a new character in my hands and a new story to tell im going to feel that same healthy fear its like food for me paltrow i admire that its so cool to hear how it feeds you like that cruz speaking of food i admire what you are doing i wrote you as much in an email a few months ago saying its very brave what you do with goop youre opening a lot of peoples eyes sometimes people are resistant to look at those things but i feel like thats because in a way they know youre talking a lot of truth there are very few people in the world who are making real changes what youre doing is huge the ones who dont know they will know soon paltrow thank you so much but i need to get back to my interview here i am so excited for murder on the orient express i was an agatha christie obsessive when i was a teenager cruz i love kenneth branagh and everybody in this cast kenneth called me and said im thinking about you to play pilar would you like to do this i said yes the 13 of us together on that train it was incredible paltrow were you really on a train cruz even though it was fake we really felt like we were traveling everywhere i looked i was like theres judi dench and michelle pfeiffer and this one and that one i taught all of them to play werewolves and villagers i would set up a time and place for us all to play but then i wouldnt go and then the next day everyone would come up to me and say its your fault we didnt sleep we played for seven hours it was the perfect game for this cast because its all about lying and manipulating paltrow how does it work when you go on location does the whole family come with you cruz yes we try to take turns when it comes to working except of course when were in the same movie like with loving pablo paltrow did you shoot that in colombia cruz yeah in bogot paltrow ive always wanted to go cruz it was great being there the people were so sweet to us and it was very important to be there because we had to really master the accent in spanish and then translate it into english its a very different accent than the way we speak paltrow the other project of yours that im dying over is the assassination of gianni versace i saw pictures you look incredible as donatella cruz from the moment i got the call from ryan murphy i thought why did you think of me for that character thats very interesting i know her a little bit and i really like her i had a few questions about how he was going to handle her portrayal but hes so classy and hes very respectful to people this is a delicate story because im playing someone who is alive someone who lost her brother in a horrible way and someone who still misses him very much 20 years later i was not used to the rhythm of doing television paltrow its fast cruz getting four monologues two days before the shoot and i was doing english with an italian accent i was like this is impossible but then you just do it paltrow when i did glee i was like what do you mean were shooting a whole musical number in half a day i couldnt believe it and then after tv you go back to doing a movie and youre like this is so slow cruz i know now im shooting a movie with asghar farhadi the director of the salesman and a separation in spain i look at my dialogue and im like uhh okay i got this laughs paltrow how did you go about preparing to play donatella versace did you watch interviews cruz i worked a lot with a dialogue coach to find the way that donatella speaks which is a little different from the way she spoke in the 90s the accent that she has its italian with a very international flavorvery rock n roll i didnt want to do an imitation of donatella or a caricature i wanted to try to capture the essence of who she is paltrow did you speak to her about it cruz a little bit i needed that conversation i really hope that when she sees the show shes going to be happy im sure there are going to be scenes that are hard for her to watch because its a lot about the loss of her brother which of course i have so much respect for i did it with all my love from that place of devastation she had to keep this company going in his honor i dont know if she ever said this but it was a way of keeping him alive paltrow do you think youll do more tv cruz why not i would love to work with ryan and his team again paltrow have you done a play cruz no im not brave enough to do that yet paltrow do you want to cruz at some point maybe when my kids are older now isnt the time to commit to something thats every day at the same time for months i studied theater for years and ive never been more nervous than when i was in front of the other students somebody offered me tennessee williamss the rose tattoo on broadway and i was really tempted but i said no call me a coward paltrow its scary i ask because for somebody who loves the craft as much as you do i think you might really love itonce you get past the fear cruz yes i think once i do it its going to be such an addictive feeling but not yet laughs paltrow what is it like shooting a movie with javier cruz the first time we worked together as a couple was in loving pablo i was a little worried about playing these characters who are so cruel to one anotherlike how was that going to work but it went great we were there to help each other and protect each other and the director is one of our best friends we felt like it was the three of us together paltrow what do you like to do when youre not working cruz we infrequently take holidays because the kids are young and because of our jobs i try to travel no more than we have to ive only been away from my kids for a day and a half in almost seven years ive had to do that three times and im hoping it can stay that way when im not working im taking time to be a mother i can manage in the kitchen although i will never cook as well as you do paltrow thats not true cruz yes it is ive never seen anything like it when you cook its like im eating in the best restaurant in the world and you do it with such ease like oh ill just put this gigantic chicken that has 25 different flavors in the ovenive been working on it for the last five hours your house is like a threemichelinstar restaurant paltrow youre sweet but the truth is that i just really like it okay its getting late over there cruz thank you gwyneth so much for doing this paltrow oh my god are you kidding te quiero mucho cruz te quiero mucho ciao gwyneth paltrow is an academy awardwinning actress cookbook author and owner of the lifestyle company goop she will be seen next year in the film

gossipcop-917153,1,the bachelor abc exec reveals the real story behind aries breakup and the next bachelorette spoiler alert do not read ahead if you have not watched the finale of arie luyendyk jrs season of the bachelor or after the final rose as host chris harrison warns each and every season the bachelor finale is always dramatic but this weeks controversial closer had an unprecedented ending which has since stirred an uproar on monday nights finale the bachelor arie luyendyk jr proposed to becca kufrin and the couple was engaged however over the next two months after the season had wrapped luyendyk had a change of heart and realized he made the wrong choice and was actually in love with runnerup lauren burnham so he broke up with kufrin and the entire thing was caught on film abcs cameras followed luyendyk as he broke off his engagement to kufrin and the network aired the scene completely unedited showing exactly what happened between the pair during the difficult conversation the following night on after the final rose kufrin was named abcs next leading lady who will star in the bachelorette and her journey to find love again began last night on after the final rose meanwhile luyendyk sat down with burnham on after the final rose as the glowing couple told america about their rekindled relationship over the past two months and then luyendyk proposed to burnham the two are now engaged and have embarked on a mini media tour sitting down with jimmy kimmel and making appearances today on abcs good morning america and live with kelly and ryan the dramatic twopart finale has garnered overwhelming support for kufrin but has caused a social media outcry in response to luyendyks behavior here abcs executive in charge of the bachelor franchise robert mills senior vp of alternative series specials and latenight programming talks to variety about filming the breakup and choosing to air the footage completely unedited plus what he thinks about kufrin as the next bachelorette looking back on the entire season what do you think overall i liked this season i think its pretty clear we made a conscious decision to do a more straightforward season of the bachelor and i liked that because at the end of the day we really believe in this concept and really want it to be about finding love and making connections im really proud of it creatively im not blind that the ratings are down so thats a bit of a disappointment and i wish that the audience had liked this season a little better weve seen some negativity both toward arie and the some of the people in this season and the show in general so every season when the show ends me and the producers take a look at what worked and what didnt and we will work to make a phenomenal season of the bachelorette what went into the decision to film arie and becca after the proposal you had never done that before it lends credence to the fact that the bachelor is not just over the top because one of the problems with the show is that youre dating people in a way that you never would in real life and then you have to start a life with this person and so in the finale you actually see what happens in the real world its incredibly relatable and its a place weve all been the stuff you see here is stuff that weve all done and weve all been through theres heartbreak and there is hope but it is riveting and its why we watch the bachelor because when good or bad things happen we all want to relate that these things happen to other people when the show really does that its when its at its best what was your reaction when arie started having second thoughts and wanted to break up with becca to get back together with lauren you go to the place where you say this will be great riveting tv but youve got to realize that these are real people not just becca but arie and lauren and this could happen to anyone so i think that makes it really difficult part of the importance of doing this on camera is its sort of a contract with the audience that youre going to see the whole relationship from beginning to end on tv and youre taking that journey with them and its important to understand the whole thing because now there will be no doubt in anyones mind what the reason is that arie and becca broke up people can feel how they want to after seeing it as opposed to just hearing about it you have never shown footage of a couple after the proposal and in this case you filmed for an additional two months in future seasons will you be continuing to film couples after the proposal the things weve learned with the bachelor is that it has to constantly evolve like you see with the fantasy suite now you see the morning after and thats really important because its a totally different phase of the relationship and those conversations inform how all of the decisions are going to be made so this change is the same thing and i think youll start to see more of this now as we keep evolving the show was it just a coincidence that the first time you decided to continue to film after the proposal that this bombshell breakup happened it wasnt purposeful a lot of the stuff was shot on iphones and its just stuff that we had of them being together and being kind of goofy together it was interesting watching it and getting to see how these people are in real life so i am glad it gave us a reason to use that iphone footage and i think well look at how we can implement that more in seasons going forward but it wasnt like oh my god thank god we had this footage it just worked itself in organically into the fabric of the finale can you clear up the timeline of the proposal and the breakup and lauren starting to date arie the proposal happened right before thanksgiving and then the breakup happened in january so it was almost two months in between and thats when arie asked lauren for a second chance just so they can date and that was two months ago and things are going incredibly well how long after the breakup did abc ask becca to be the bachelorette you have to be respectful you cant say you just had your heart broken do you want to meet 25 new guys it was a very slow process fortunately we had time because this was midjanuary and the finale doesnt air until midmarch i know two months doesnt seem like a lot and the feelings are still raw but she still just wanted to keep trying i think when youve had great tragedy in your life like shes had there is a resilience that starts to come in and you realize that for better or worse life goes on and youre better off taking a chance so we moved slowly asking her to be the bachelorette but when she came around to it it got really exciting it started very slowly and then it got very serious in the middle of february she actually hadnt signed until basically a couple of days ago so it was definitely a lot of thinking shes also very close with her family and i dont know if her family wanted her to jump right back into a show that caused her so much heartbreak but they are supportive and thats fantastic theres been a lot of discussion surrounding the lack of diversity with leads on the bachelor franchise and just last year rachel lindsay was the firstever african american lead on the bachelorette what went into the decision naming becca next seasons lead im super proud of this cast from aries season we look at everything and diversity is not only ethnicity but also its the types of women that we had and i was really happy that we had a lot of types of different women we had a lot of professional women and strong women who are their own women with becca it was really a nobrainer decision i think everybody after they see how this plays out theyre going to want to see her get her happy ending this is a girl whos been through so much she lost her dad to brain cancer her mother had a battle with breast cancer shes really strong and resilient and you really root for her after the finale earlier in the season beccas boyfriend from her past showed up and a lot of people on twitter criticized that scene for seeming staged solely to create drama he obviously didnt just pop up in peru so how did he show up im really glad you asked that we sit down at the end of every season and we look at things and we say this is good this worked people didnt like this or people responded to this for me and the producers something that really didnt sit right was when demarios jackson girlfriend came back in rachels lindsay season it just felt completely fake and it felt like this woman had a speech prepared and was ready to go so when you see all of that if it plays as false then it pulls on a sweater thread and the whole thing can fall apart because it all seems false and its not so in this case this guy reached out to production and said he heard becca was on the show and he was really upset and wanted to see her and as a producer you think thats a great storyline if its authentic but at the very least we had to make sure that this guy was willing to put up the money to get to peru and see if this guy is genuine and didnt want to just get on tv and he did so once we realized that this guy really has feelings for becca and he wants to go we did it this was a guy that becca had spoken about many times on the show as the one big relationship that she had and seven years thats a long time so thats how it all came to be why did you originally cast arie as this seasons lead is it because he is a bit older and perhaps ready for a real relationship its funny because arie is the same age as nick viall but i think the reason why arie comes off as older is because he has a more mature lifestyle nick viall almost feels like an earlytomid 20something who is still figuring himself out and moved to la arie lives in scottsdale ariz where hes showing houses and hes even slowed down with the racing hes a grownup i think thats the difference and thats part of what went into the decisionmaking i thought nicks season was great and i absolutely love nick but you watched that finale last year and he got engaged to vanessa grimaldi and it should have been this fullcircle moment for him because he got so close with andi dorfmann and then he got so close with kaitlyn bristowe and then he finally found this person and it just felt like this thing is going to last for five minutes and thats what ended up happening and everyone has to do their own thing so im not decrying anything that he did but it just felt like we really wanted to find someone who was going to leave the spotlight after this was over and thats arie he was never one of those people that was really on social media and stayed in the bachelor circle he was just living his life it seems like the intention in casting arie was to make this season the most authentic it could possibly be when it comes to looking for love so why do you think ratings were down this season i dont know but i will tell you that i was surprised when the ratings were up when nick viall was the bachelor so sometimes you just dont know nick was a rollofthedice because hed been on bachelor in paradise which is not usually the breeding ground for the lead so sometimes you cant put your finger on these things when sean lowe was the bachelor it really came down to him and arie and it was down to the wire because people really wanted to see arie be the bachelor because he was so heartbroken by emily maynard so when we were making the bachelor this year it was surprising how many people said they didnt know who he was i know five years is not yesterday but its also not so long ago he was somebody who always remained in the conversation with fans maybe not as many as i thought but i thought there was a lot of appeal for arie and it was fascinating to see that we had to reeducate people on arie on i think arie also had to reeducate himself what its like to be on this type of show i think he has a lot of personality and its really on us for not showing more of that you saw on the women tell all that he is really very funny and i think if we had maybe shown more of that maybe that would have helped also we premiered on new years day and then the next day was the college football championship game and then you had the olympics so we had a lot of strikes against us but it still felt like people cared i heard a lot of chatter about the season online so you believe the numbers being down are due to competing programming and perhaps the lack of awareness for arie not any sort of bachelor fatigue among audiences i dont think theres bachelor fatigue the people that are watching certainly all seem to like it and live for it they might not like certain elements but i havent seen anyone say im done watching the bachelor but it is an interesting time right now in the world and there might be people who say i just dont feel like i can get an escape right now because the world is in a weird place on the flip side of that do you think the political climate and intense news cycle serve as a benefit to the show because it can be an escape for viewers i think thats right even when things are horrible on the show as weve seen in this finale there still is a measure of hope at the end of the day we are trying to make a version of a fairytale here and there is something about love that is hopeful even when it is love thats lost theres always going to be hope at the end of the day there is something hopeful and escapist about this show weve all made a fool of ourselves or gotten dumped so i think theres so much relatability to show what do you expect beccas season of the bachelorette to be like this could be one of the stranger seasons of the bachelorette because she might not truly be over arie and it may not work i certainly hope it does and we will do everything we possibly can to make sure it does but you just dont know it certainly is a chance worth taking popular

politifact13229,1,donald trump featured in new jihadist recruitment video last month the washington post reported that white nationalists have begun using republican presidential candidate donald trump as a recruitment tool now the polarizing republican presidential frontrunner has become the recruitment fodder for another group of marginalized extremists a propaganda video released by the somalibased alqaeda affiliate alshabab includes a clip of trump calling on the united states to bar muslims from entering the country according to news reports trump made the statement following the islamic stateinspired shootings in san bernardino calif last month the video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon african americans to join a holy war against the united states according to the bbc claiming the united states is a hotbed of racial inequality police brutality and antimuslim sentiment the film is an indictment of us race relations and also includes historical civil rightsera footage of malcolm x an unnamed white supremacist and african americans in prison according to cnn 3 new shabaab vid shows trump proposing muslim travel ban awlaki predicting bigotry concentration camps pictwittercom2kmpzyf3ui rita katz ritakatz january 1 2016 the clip showing trump the bbc noted arrives 10 minutes into the 51minute propaganda video advertisement on either side of the trump footage nbc reported are clips of anwar alawlaki the late alqaeda recruiter urging muslims in the united states to move to islamic countries or wage war against the west at home a us citizen alawlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in yemen in 2011 yesterday america was a land of slavery segregation lynching and ku klux klan and tomorrow it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage he adds the west will eventually turn against its muslim citizens the alkataib media foundation released the video on twitter on friday according to nbc trumps campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment but saturday afternoon news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in biloxi miss they began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak and they utterly rejected the premise that trump was providing grist for propagandists advertisement some wondered whether the video was real more insisted that the alqaeda affiliate was attacking trump out of fear isis alshabaad alqaeda all those groups they dont want trump in office said richard coyne 52 an army veteran from nearby gulfport who retired last year they want the status quo which is unfortunately proisis proalqaeda promuslim isis is another name for the extremist group islamic state sarah anderson 57 of hattiesburg also an army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the berlin wall said that any terrorist group that cited trump was doing so because it is scared to death of him hes a threat to them she said thats the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want some voters were unaware of the video but well aware that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton had warned of trumps rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists tom simmons a 68yearold vietnam war veteran from nearby vancleave was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory advertisement i cant comprehend anything that the democrats say simmons said the terrorists fear trump right now theyre going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous in controversial remarks made after the san bernardino attack trump called for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our countrys representatives can figure out what the hell is going on the propaganda video includes that line but bleeps out the word hell according to cnn in the wake of the paris attacks trump said he would strongly consider shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others i would hate to do it but its something that youre going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred the absolute hatred is coming from these areas trump said in an interview on morning joe republican presidential candidate donald trump is saying democratic candidate hillary clinton lied about him at saturdays debate and is demanding an apology video abc newsnbc news the video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between trump and hillary clinton in which clinton has claimed trumps language aids jihadists advertisement if you go on arabic television as we have and you look at what is being blasted out video of mr trump being translated to arabic clinton said at an iowa town hall last month no muslims coming to the united states other kinds of derogatory defamatory statements it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists trumps comments clinton added lights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways trump responded to clintons assertion by calling her a liar its just another hillary lie trump said on nbc newss meet the press late last month shes a liar and everybody knows that david weigel contributed to this

step i said if i had fallen anywhere else i would have been absolutely fine but its just because there was i went to catch myself and i missed i thought i just busted my lip then i walked inside and

politifact7595,1,mark kelly on whether call to action on gun control is fading cardinal donald wuerl on new pope written by chris wallace published march 31 2013 fox news sunday special guests capt mark kelly cardinal donald wuerl the following is a rush transcript of the march 31 2013 edition of fox news sunday with chris wallace this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host im chris wallace the debate over gun control heats up begin videotape wallace one hundred days after newtown congress gets ready to vote on new measures to prevent mass shootings but is the call to action starting to fade well ask a leading voice in the debate former astronaut mark kelly husband of gabrielle giffords its a fox news sunday exclusive then how will the new pope change the catholic church as the world celebrates easter pope francis must shepherd the church out of scandal and confront challenges to catholic doctrine well talk with the archbishop of washington cardinal donald wuerl plus north korea enters a state of war against south korea well ask our sunday panel have the fiery threats reached the danger point and our power player of the week the untold story of how a doctor saved the life of ronald reagan all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace hello again and happy easter from fox news in washington well after months of debate the senate is finally ready to vote on new gun control legislation one of the people at the center of the issue is mark kelly retired astronaut and navy captain and the husband of former congresswoman gabrielle giffords who was shot two years ago captain kelly joins us from tucson arizona captain after newtown there was national outrage over these acts of mass violence but that has begun to change cbs has a new poll just after the massacre 57 percent supported stricter gun controls now thats down to 47 percent and senate majority leader harry reid says the bill hell introduce the week after next wont include a ban on assault weapons and wont include a limit on high capacity magazines question should president obama have moved faster to bring it to a vote before the call for action began to fade captain mark kelly ret us navy well i think after something like you know 20 first graders being murdered in their classrooms you know it is important to take action and the american people are demanding action now you know the timeline of that you know sometimes especially with a polarized congress these things can take a long time but its clear and you say that you know there is less support and i want to address that for a second when you use words like gun control you know gun control doesnt poll very well but we do know that over 90 percent of americans support a universal background check and there is incredible momentum in congress and around the nation to get this done wallace well you say incredible momentum five republican senators say that they are going to filibuster any additional gun restrictions we have them up on the screen what do you say for instance to marco rubio and rand paul kelly well first i would say to marco rubio that 94 percent of his constituents support a universal background check for senator rand paul its about 83 percent in kentucky so they should listen to their constituents and certainly shouldnt be getting in the way of the process which is to debate the bill and to vote on the bill i mean that doesnt make any sense and i imagine that at some point if they actually do this that their constituents will hold them accountable for those actions wallace why do you think there is in polls i mean there are a couple of things going on here one we see in the polls diminishing support two we see harry reid who is you know the senate majority leader and hes not even going to include the high capacity magazines or the assault weapons ban in the bill theyll be a vote of amendments but theyre not part of the bill he says in the assault weapons ban it wouldnt get 40 votes let alone 60 whats going on kelly well certainly you know in this country we have a very powerful gun lobby and the leadership of the nra has done a very good job over many many years of controlling the debate on this issue but one thing that is different now is the fact that we had 20 first graders murdered in a classroom along with six educators i mean thats unacceptable and the american people you know want something done on this you know 92 percent of americans support a universal background check its 74 percent of nra members i would hope at some point that the leadership of the nra would just listen to their membership on this issue wallace were going to get to the background check in a second one last question about the senate because republicans say they are going to offer an alternative bill that would crack down on gun trafficking and would beef up school safety it would not include the background check or an assault weapons ban what do you think of whats called the grassley alternative kelly well you know i think it is a mistake any bill that does not include a universal background check is a mistake its the most commonsense thing that we can do to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from having access to weapons i mean the system we have right now we have 40 percent of all americans who buy a gun buy it without a background check and thats probably where most of the criminals and the mentally ill are going i mean we know from a poll that has been done with criminals in prison that over 80 percent of them get them through that loophole so it would be a mistake not to address the thing that 92 percent of american households support and 74 percent of nra members support which is the universal background check wallace all right well lets pick up on that because the main feature of what is going to be in the senate bill and what you are pushing and pushing today is the universal background check this week you went or rather recently a few weeks ago you went to a gun store in the arizona area and bought a 45 caliber hand gun and afterwards discussed the background check you had to go through with your wife gabby lets take a look begin video clip kelly it was very easy to do it took just like five minutes former rep gabby giffords dariz yes five minutes kelly you know thats all we have to do to make sure everybody has to get a background check before buying a gun to make sure that criminals and the mentally ill cant get one giffords universal background check kelly yes end video clip wallace captain kelly what do you think that showed kelly well you know we went in there my executive director inaudible the executive of our organization and in five minutes and 36 seconds is the time it took to fill out one piece of paper you only have to fill out one side for it to be submitted to the national instant criminal background check system and get an answer five minutes and 36 seconds so what it shows you is that it is not the burden that the nra leadership says what a background check is i mean its s a simple common sense thing we can do to make sure criminals and the mentally ill cant have access to firearms wallace well lets talk about that because in gabbys tragic case the shooter jared loughner had been suspended from college because he was deemed to be a threat to himself and to others he went to a gun store he got a gun passed a background check and yet was able to go out and shoot gabby and 18 other people and the nra says the problem with the background check is that the kind of mental health information for instance in loughners case doesnt get passed on so it doesnt get to be part of the background check kelly well it doesnt get passed on in a lot of cases you know you know 19 states have included less than 100 records on mental illness into the nics into the national instant criminal background check system in the case of the shooter in tucson the information on his mental illness that caused him to get expelled from community college that should have been in the system his admitted drug use to the us army who rejected him that should have been in the system so he should have if we had you know a system if we improved the system he would have been rejected from buying the gun in the gun store now the other problem is theres the other loophole right theres the records loophole but there is the loophole that would allow him to go to a gun show or on the internet to buy a gun and we need to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from doing that its crazy that we have a system you know we have a system that responsible gun owners get a background check and the option to avoid one is available for anybody who doesnt want to do it i mean its a its a crazy system wallace but doesnt the nra have a point if youre going to expand the background check and cover more people dont you have to make sure the mental health information gets into the system because otherwise its kind of a waste of time kelly they absolutely have a point i mean they are they are right on that issue i mean we need to encourage states to include the mental health records after virginia tech for instance virginia was one of the worst states on this and after what happened in virginia tech theyre actually really really good about getting those records to the federal government so im encouraging i mean i would love to be able to work with the leadership of the nra and work with the united states senate and the house to make sure we get those records in the system and then close the gun show and private seller loophole like 92 percent of americans want like 74 percent of nra members want wallace the big holdup in the senate now over the background check is that if you do expand it to include gun shows and private sales do the people who sell the guns in those cases have to keep private records keep records of those sales and as you well know the nra says the danger is that if they have to do what licensed dealers have to do and keep those records that could be used to form a national registry and somewhere down the line that could be used to confiscate peoples guns how do you respond to that kelly well i just dont think its logical i mean right now when you buy a gun in a gun store like i did you know there is a record that remains with the gun store its not a record with the federal government it is not a record that is going to one day lead to a national registry or gun confiscation so the system currently works with the federally licensed firearms dealers there is no reason that same system cannot work with the gun show and the private seller but of course this is an issue for many you know some republican senators and its certainly something that could be worked on i mean weve got a lot of smart members in the senate and i think they can figure out a compromise on this issue wallace finally arizona officials this week released a lot of records about the shooter jared loughner the man who shot gabby and 18 others his parents it turns out knew he was deeply disturbed they tested him for drugs but they did not send him to get help what do you have to say after learning all of this to jared loughners parents kelly well certainly as a parent myself i understand i mean it is a tragic thing they went through as well it would have been an entirely different situation however if he would have gotten some mental health you know gotten an evaluation and when he you know certainly in his case when hes taking medication hes not as psychotic as without the medication so this would have clearly been would not have happened if he would have had proper mental health treatment you know but you cant you know you cant go back in time i mean theres you know the only thing we can do is move forward and try to make sure that the dangerously mentally ill are not only getting treatment for their mental illness but lets make sure they dont have access to guns lets make sure criminals dont have access to guns i mean our organization americans for responsible solutions i mean we are really focused on this every single day to make sure we fix this problem and we address gun violence in this country wallace i just want to pick up on that last point because after newtown there was a lot of talk about making it easier for authorities a school or a family to commit a jared loughner an adam lanza the newtown shooter before they got access to guns and acted out in this horrible way but that seems to have been forgotten in all of the debate about gun control kelly well i dont know if it has been forgotten i mean certainly you know the debate in the senate is going to going to include some aspect of help for the mentally ill now what that is you know im not you know i dont know what those details how thats going to turn out but that is certainly an important component of this i mean to address mental illness in this country to get those records of mental illness into the system and then to make sure that there isnt a loophole where the clearly dangerously and mentally ill and criminals can get access to a gun wallace captain kelly we want to thank you thank you for joining us and we want to wish you and your wife gabby the very best sir kelly thank you and happy easter chris wallace happy easter to you up next on this easter sunday well discuss the new pope and the challenges he faces as we talk with one of the men who elected him washingtons cardinal donald wuerl commercial break wallace today at the vatican pope francis celebrated his first easter mass as leader of the worlds 1 billion catholics in the traditional easter message the pope called for a political solution to the civil war in syria as well as peace on the korean peninsula as his papacy begins francis has set a humble tone in contrast to the corruption and scandal in some parts of the church but how much does the new pope intend to shake things up earlier i asked the archbishop of washington cardinal donald wuerl what he thinks pope francis will do begin videotape wallace your eminence happy easter and welcome back to fox news sunday cardinal donald wuerl archbishop of washington thank you its great to be back wallace from the moment he took the world stage pope francis talked about serving the poorest the weakest the least important on holy thursday he followed the tradition of washing the feet of 12 people but instead of 12 priests as other popes have done he washed and kissed the feet of a dozen young inmates including women and muslims question what message is the pope sending about what he is going to do wuerl i think his message is a very clear one that you bear witness with words but you also bear witness with actions and i think what he is trying to say to all of us is if we really are trying to introduce people to the gospel if we are really trying to tell believers how important the gospel is cant you do that as well maybe even better with actions as well as words i think thats what hes trying to do wallace there is a widespread sense that the church has problems governance problems that there is corruption inside the church that there are turf wars one of the first things the pope has to deal with is that secret investigative report about the vatican leaks why did the cardinals believe that pope francis was the right man to clean things up wuerl i think there are probably a couple of ideas that were going around as we were talking about who might be the next pope who would be the best person to choose one when we talk about the church we also want to make sure that we distinguish it from just the operation of the vatican i think we were concerned about who will keep the momentum of the new evangelization going and who will keep this energy the church is seeing among many of our young people around the world who will keep that going at the same time somebody has to address the administration of the holy see somebody has to take a look at what is working and what isnt working i cant tell you what that means because we didnt have the report but the very fact that we recognize there needs to be some change that was a part of the thinking can you can you envision someone better than pope francis the credibility he brings to whatever he decides in the vatican is going to be enormous but in the meantime he is keeping the focus on the rest of the church where there is an awful lot of good going on wallace but on the inside game how aggressive a reformer how revolutionary if you will do you expect pope francis to be not on doctrine but on changing the way the church does business wuerl well perhaps were seeing signs of it in the fact that he hasnt moved in to the papal residence that hes chosen to stay in the residence where we all were for the conclave maybe hes simply saying there are going to be a lot of changes were going to get back to something that will be a little more direct and maybe contact with the pope will be a little easier and that was one of the things that we cardinals talked about the need to find ways in which there is a lot more communication between the rest of the church and the pope wallace all right you were there we saw all of the pictures take us inside this is your first conclave take us inside the sistine chapel they closed the doors the 115 cardinal electors are all there and you are choosing the head of church for 12 billion 13 billion catholics what is that moment like wuerl there is a solemnness that i really wasnt prepared to experience as fully when you hear that door closing you hear it and the that bolt is locked then you realize this is really a liturgy were all were all wearing what we would wear if we were presiding at a mass somewhere not as the celebrant but simply as a cardinal this absolute silence and the one thing you are supposed to be doing is listening with your heart before i went in i talked to one of the older cardinals hes 90 years old he came to one of those general meetings just so we could chat i have known him for 40 years and i said to him cardinal i am feeling a little bit overwhelmed by all of this he said when you get into the sistine chapel and they close that door just listen with your heart and youll hear and it turned out to be true there is a solemn oath you take and then chris when the moment comes to write a name on the ballot there is nobody there but you and i like to think the holy spirit guiding that pen wallace im fascinated there were five ballots obviously the fifth ballot you chose the pope after a ballot and they tell you soandso bergoglio pope francis has so many votes do you mill about and talk and wuerl no this is the interesting thing they count the ballots and that in itself is rather solemn three people look at each ballot and go through the whole thing so once its clear no one was elected nothing is said there is this moment quiet and then you just write another name on the next ballot it is as if the holy spirit is saying look now you know the direction ok youre going to have to youre going to have to whittle this down this is the power of the part though chris you have your ballot in your hand and you have to stand there in front of that fresco of the last judgment and say i call on christ the lord who will come to judge me that this ballot is for the person i believe should serve and lead the church and its really powerful but there is no milling about there is no discussion there its altogether different than anything that you and i have experienced in our life here politically there are no nominations no candidates its all open to the action of the spirit wallace not exactly like pulling the lever on election day the big story in washington this week as you well know has been the supreme courts consideration of the issue of same sex marriage if the court finds that there is a constitutional right what will you say to gays who are good catholics attend church every week who say who believe that god made them that way and who want to commit to a partner wuerl we are always welcoming of everyone the catholic church welcomes everyone but the catholic church also reminds all of us there is a moral law there are commandments of god and we have to do our best to live by them we announce that from the pulpit and we try to meet people where they are and walk with them in lifes journey the church is probably with 20 centuries of experience probably the most understanding of the human condition of any institution but at the same time it does remind not only gay people but heterosexual people straight people youre not supposed to be following a moral law apart from what christ has said to us we do that all the time wallace so specifically what do you say what would you say to the good gay catholic wuerl i think we try to work with them whatever situation they find themselves in the goal is to hold them as close to the church and to christ and the sacraments as possible a lot depends on how well were able to communicate how well were able in a pastoral situation to look at each persons life and see where we are wallace so you would allow him to continue in the church but you would not recognize his marriage wuerl we do that with people who are married divorced and remarried we say you are still part of the family but we cant recognize that second marriage we do that weve done that and it has never been a great problem its painful for all of us to have to realize that making our way through life is difficult and that we cant always be as perfect as away would like to be i look to the church to say to me look walk as close to christ as you can thats why we are here come to mass participate in the life of the church wallace i want to ask you about the legal situation canada legalized same sex marriage in 2005 and there have been legal problems there was a case of a knights of columbus hall that had agreed to hold a reception for a married couple until they found out that it was a same sex couple and they had to pay a fine and there are questions about a catholic university that has housing for married couples what are they going to do if its a same sex couple how is the church and the writ large not just the church but the whole religious institution how is it going to deal with that and doesnt it get a little bit to the issue you have with the administration about the mandate of insurance policies including birth control wuerl shouldnt there be enough space in a society as pluralistic and free as america is to be able to work all of these things out in a way that everybody can be who they are and carry on their activities im thinking for example when we talk about changing the definition of marriage there is going to have to be a lot of adjusting because the whole world has always understood marriage is the word you use to describe when a man and a woman commit to each other for the rest of their lives and generate and educate children once you change that arbitrarily there is going to be downstream from that all kinds of questions were going to have to deal with them one by one as we come to them and thats why the church keeps saying make room for everyones faith the only thing i worry about is someone saying to see you because you believe that sex is intended for marriage and because you believe that marriage is undissolvable and because you believe that marriage is between a man and a woman that somehow you dont belong here that somehow this is this is bigotry or this is hate speech thats what i worry about there has to be room enough in the society as large as free and as pluralistic as america to make space for all of us wallace finally for all of the controversies this is easter which has a very joyous meaning what is your message your easter message for our viewers wuerl the easter message for every christian is christ is risen and thats we say hallelujah come to mass but for the rest of the world easter is also a reminder of hope there is always hope individually collectively societally we should never give up hope that we can make things better thats the story of easter for the believer its hallelujah for everyone else it should be there is hope there is a possibility to make it a better world wallace and its a beautiful spring and flowers are blooming and all is right with the world cardinal thank you so much wuerl you are very welcome thank you chris end videotape wallace the archbishop of washington cardinal donald wuerl up next a threat to peace in the pacific well ask our sunday group how serious is north koreas drumbeat of war commercial break begin video clip chuck hagel defense secretary their very provocative actions and belligerent tone it has ratcheted up the danger end video clip wallace defense secretary chuck hagel responding to north koreas threat of war against the us and south korea and it is time now for our sunday group bill kristol of the weekly standard mara liasson of national public radio republican strategist ed gillespie and charles lane of the washington post well kim jong un the young leader of north korea was quoted friday as ordering his missile units to be ready to strike the us and south korea and this photo was released kim meeting with top north korean generals with a chart showing the trajectory of their missiles hitting major american cities bill what is kims game bill kristol the weekly standard who knows but its not good i mean theyve murdered starved millions of their own people that regime and now and they proliferated nuclear weapons and dont forget the israeli strike on the syrian nuclear weapons plant in 2007 that was given to them by north korea so even if you discount north korea oh they are containable they are not going to destroy their regime by attacking us they can proliferate weapons of mass destruction they can proliferate nuclear weapons and missiles and guess what iran and north korea have this dark relationship and north korea is short of cash it could sell these weapons to terrorist groups so the threat of north korea is very real wallace and why do you think they are ratcheting up he is ratcheting up the tension kristol well the normal explanation is that it helps stabilize and you know helps secure his situation at home maybe that is true but the degree to which you know theyve created he might think hes being playing two games like his father and his grandfather did i guess and you know they can pull back at the key moment but you know south korea and japan are sitting there nervous he killed south koreans just about two years ago three years ago they killed what 45 south korean sailors attacked their ship i mean japan they lobbed a missile over japan its dangerous wallace yeah let me pick up on that mara because the north koreans traditionally as bill points out like to bluster and saber rattle but even by their standards this is pretty extreme what is going on now and that is the concern that somehow particularly with south korean if youve ever been in seoul i mean it is an hours drive from the dmz i mean they would be right on the front line the danger is it gets out of hand mara liasson national public radio the danger is it gets out of hand and that crazy map behind kim jongun which showed the lines of the missiles hitting the mainland of the united states and exposing their quote battle plans that might be a fantasy but they can do tremendous damage to south korea and hes announced also that the armistice doesnt hold anymore they are back in a state of war nobody knows exactly what he wants to do i dont even know if he knows what he wants to do but yes it is a really dangerous situation and i dont think the united states has a clear idea of what to do to stop him wallace well lets talk ed about the us response because first chuck hagel the defense secretary announced that we are beefing up our missile defense along the border with alaska and then this week in alaska again along the border with russia and then this week we sent as you can see there a pair of b2 stealth bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons all the way from missouri to military exercises over south korea ed sensible reaction by the pentagon or overreaction ed gillespie fmr romney campaign senior adviser no i think its a sensible reaction and i think in addition to that it would be good for the administration to not only bolster our own missile defense but to support japan and south korea with missile defense i think to bills point they are nervous understandably and i think doing anything everything we can to reassure them would be helpful and obviously you know trying to get china to engage in their own region in a way that would be helpful i think with kim jongun would be important too wallace im going to pick up on china in a second your thoughts though chuck about the us response what we have done so far what more we can do charles lane the washington post well i think president obamas approach to north korea throughout his presidency has been essentially not to rise to the bait and i think that has been a good approach so far i think sending the b2s sent a strong signal i think what we are dealing with here is sort of the third generation of a family business over there in north korea and the business is building up this whole military structure building up as bill suggests the capability to proliferate conducting terrorist activities people forget that years ago they blew up a whole group of south korean diplomats in burma of all places and the purpose of the family business is through the constant threat constant belligerence constant menace to extract money concessions and everything else you can get by blackmailing the other side whether the endgame of the family business is to actually go to war in south korea i doubt because i think people are need to remember north korea would not win that war at the very least would come out of it very badly damaged so i think what we are seeing here is a generation of war hysteria to help control themselves inside and the generation of threats especially towards this new more conservative less concessionminded government in south korea to see what they can extract as they have now for 20 years since this nuclear issue began wallace you know one of the concerns here and that does seem to be different bill is that north korea seems to be ignoring the warnings from its main far and away biggest sponsor china which had warned the regime and kim jongun not to make these threats against the united states not to make these threats against south korea and yet it proceeded with them why would kim risk alienating the country that literally you know talk about biting the hand that feeds you that literally feeds its people kristol well china never seemed to really have been willing to pull the trigger and stop feeding his people or stop providing other kinds of aid to north korea so theyve gotten away with this in the past and the chinese have been unwilling to risk undermining allowing the north korean regime to be undermined and to fall with the unified korea and i think thats dangerous to them i dont know why korea isnt going to invade china but nonetheless they want to preserve they dont want the east european model of communist regimes falling on their border the us what can we do we can get serious about missile defense we spend about 15 percent of our defense budget on missile defense the obama administration having canceled the ground base interceptors then restored them just what a couple of weeks ago and said were going ahead on it but basically under both parties really but especially under the democrats theres been a sort of very haphazard inaudible through to president reagans announcement 30 years ago the inaudible made a decision really and maybe we should try to defend ourselves from nuclear weapons and not just accept them as inevitable and i think in a postcold war world we dont know the north korean regime could be ten or 20 years from now and they could have many more missiles and many more nuclear weapons and they could be proliferating them im not sure well find them or the israelis will know whether they have proliferated dont we want to get serious and spend some real money and really invest in serious missile defense for ourselves and our neighbors crosstalk wallace ed the president has kind of flipped on missile defense gillespie yeah wallace because when he first came in he pulled back on some of the deployment of antimissile interceptors now one of his first steps he and chuck hagel at the pentagon was to beef up our interceptors system up along the alaska coast gillespie yeah and like i said they should be commended for that ill take one exception bill im not i think president bush did make a priority of missile defense and one of the first things that the obama administration did was to reverse that and now theyve reversed themselves again understanding that there was a reason for it an important strategic reason for it and im glad they reversed themselves i wish they hadnt reversed themselves in the first place or reverse the policy in the first place but we have this is an example of why we need missile defense and we need for our friends to have it as well wallace all right we have to take a break here but when we come back after this weeks historic supreme court hearings on same sex marriage where does the issue stand now commercial break begin video clip supreme court justice samuel alito you want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution which is newer than cell phones or the internet i mean we we are not we do not have the ability to see the future supreme court justice elena kagan supposed the states said because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55 would that be constitutional end video clip wallace supreme court justices samuel alito and elena kagan differing on whether the court should intervene in the issue of same sex marriage were back now with the panel so at the end of a rare two days of arguments bill where do you think the court is on the constitutional question of same sex marriage and also on the defense of marriage act which denies federal benefits to same sex couples who have been legally married in their states kristol i mean it looks as if the court will strike down part of the defense of marriage act on sort of federalism grounds and wallace but its a state issue not a federal issue kristol right and the federal government in a way is putting a thumb on the scale by preferring traditional marriage to states that by preferring states that have chosen traditional marriage over states that have chosen same sex marriage and it looks as if the court is not going to impose a universal constitutional right to same sex marriage on the nation and i hope they dont and i i think they wont wallace do you think that they will leave prop 8 alone and just lets say deny it on procedural grounds the plaintiff didnt have standing or do you think that they might decide yes prop 8 either stands or falls in california but that doesnt impact other states kristol yeah i cant i cant tell it it is hard to read and maybe others know better than i do what the court is going to do wallace all right well go down the list down the row here and see but one of the points mara that several justices made is that public opinion is changing so quickly on this issue both in the polls and four states in 2012 legalized same sex marriage that perhaps the court should stay out of it and leave it to the political process in the states in that sense could the supporters of same sex marriage be victims of their own success liasson yes i think they could and i actually think the best outcome for democrats and even proponents of same sex marriage is if prop 8 is upheld in california but there is no sweeping constitutional finding that same sex marriage is legal all over the country because wallace well if prop 8 is upheld that means that same sex marriage is banned liasson no im sorry prop 8 is the lower court ruling is upheld which means prop 8 is overturned wallace ok liasson im sorry about that but if they want to in california right now they could back and put up prop 82 legalizing same sex marriage and it would probably pass it is a lot more meaningful and profound to kind of adjudicate divisive social issues by voters and legislators not unelected justices and i think that its going to be more lasting political change if you do it at the ballot box it also means youre not going to have this huge backlash and i agree with bill i dont think the court is going in the direction of legalizing same sex marriage on the national constitutional basis wallace ed lets talk about the politics of this you of course a former chairman of the republican national committee isnt this a problem for the gop as we say public opinion is moving in the direction of support for same sex marriage especially among young people 70 80 percent of all people of all persuasions under the age of 35 40 support same sex marriage as a legal right but the polls show that republicans still overwhelmingly oppose it only 27 percent in one poll i saw support same sex marriage so where does the republican party go you have an awful lot of your base still very much opposes this but you can see the pendulum swinging for the country gillespie chris i dont see the republican party or most republicans obviously changing in terms of believing that marriage is between one man and one woman i do think that in the context of this debate as in so many other debates republicans have been cast in the negative you know in the negative to say we are opposing something as opposed to talking about what most republicans are for most republicans are also for the benefits of marriage in the legal system that are afforded the protections like for example visitation hospital visitation rights or survivorship benefits and i think you will hear more republicans making that point that we can do those things without having the government sanction same sex marriage wallace but looking at the polls and particularly looking at where younger people are going would you have any problems in 2016 with a republican party platform saying that marriage is between a man and a woman gillespie i wouldnt have any problem with that i think one of the questions is i believe the platform right now calls for a federal constitutional amendment to ban it you know there may be a debate about that wallace inaudible ban same sex marriage gillespie yeah to ban it i dont think you would ever see the republican party platform saying we are in favor of same sex marriage but there may be a question because i think to maras point the federalism aspect of this supreme court debate has been interesting and because a lot of conservatives have felt for a long time that roe was wrongfully decided and imposed wallace roe v wade gillespie roe v wade wallace 1973 gillespie and that the issue of abortion should have been left to the states for people to hash out in a more civil manner a lot of conservatives found themselves arguing in this instance that the court shouldnt impose a federal mandate that it is legal so there has been a little bit of a shift i think in terms of republicans saying we should allow this to be worked out in the states not imposed by courts and not imposed federally and it will be interesting to see how that shakes up because the platform as it is today says a federal constitutional amendment to ban it wallace we should point out it isnt just conservatives who feel that roe was wrong in this particular issue ruth bader ginsburg a justice of the supreme court appointed by democrats liberal very much an abortion rights supporter says she thinks it was a mistake because she thought it moved the court too quickly in this direction in a judicial fiat instead of leaving it to the states to work out something that they were working out chuck when you listened to what you three learned colleagues your fellow justices here on the court say your thoughts about the debate this week where it leaves the issue and the political implications lane well as to the debate not to sounds pollyanish but i thought it was actually refreshing and useful for the whole country to listen to two days of discussion among nine very intelligent people of various views who are not running for office you know and who arent obsessed with the shortterm political consequences of these things themselves but are really sort of wrestling with it in a very serious way and in that regard i think it was a very very helpful occasion in the whole debate because theyve had the sort of guts to go through a whole lot of difficult questions you know about is this really just like interracial marriage what are the social science consequences and so forth but i think what is crystallizing as a result of this is a distinction is developing between the substance of whether this is a good idea or not and the process of how we as a country are going to decide and in that respect i do think there is a a kind of a tentative consensus on the court that the procedural the optimum way to handle it is to let the states decide to give more time to the democratic process to work this thing out as opposed to having the judicial branch sort of slice through the gordian knot wallace but what about the argument for the sake of argument what about the argument look we dont decide constitutional rights lane right wallace that way we dont decide whether schools can be segregated that way we dont decide interracial marriage that way lane i think the answer ive heard from the court was were not ready to say this is a constitutional right that there isnt enough support in the text of the document or in the precedence of this court to say that without same sex marriage every state in the union is violating the constitution wallace thank you panel see you next week and dont forget to check out panelplus where our group picks right up with the discussion on our web site foxnewssundaycom well post the video before noon eastern time and make sure to follow us on twitter foxnewssunday up next our power player of the week commercial break wallace of course this is easter sunday but it was also 32 years ago this weekend a gunman tried to kill ronald reagan today a story you have never heard before about how a doctor saved the presidents life with what he believes was some divine help heres our power player of the week begin video clip dr sam spagnolo gwu va medical center and they said we need you to come over to the hospital right away wallace that was how dr sam spagnolo learned 32 years ago he was about to take on the case of his life he was the head of the lung department at george washington university hospital and ronald reagan who had sustained a gunshot to the lung was in the operating room spagnolo the bullet went through here and lodged over here on the inner surface of the lung so another inch or two and it would have been into the heart wallace spagnolo first saw the president when he was wheeled into the recovery room spagnolo and we put him on the ventilator right away and he was getting some sedation and i stayed there until we finally got him off the ventilator about 3 oclock in the morning wallace the doctor says reagan did well in the first couple of days his condition serious but not critical then things changed spagnolo kept a diary hes making public for the first time spagnolo day five april 3rd 1981 i was called at home and requested a return to the hospital i arrived at the presidential suite and asked the nurse in charge what was going on she told me the presidents temperature was almost 104 degrees and he was not looking well that made all of us a little nervous about which way this was going to go wallace on camera when you said which way this was going to go was his life is danger spagnolo at that point i thought his life was in danger wallace thats got to take your breath away spagnolo it did wallace voice over spagnolo ordered a battery of tests to check for infection but the presidents medical team resisted spagnolo things were going a little slower than id hoped wallace on camera so what did you say spagnolo if we dont get movement im not im going to walk off this case wallace voice over the other doctors agreed to the tests but they found no sign of infection still spagnolo was convinced that was the problem and put reagan on antibiotics within 24 hours his temperature went down wallace on camera honestly 30 years later what do you think would have happened if you had not intervened and given him this broad dose of antibiotics spagnolo he might not have gotten better wallace voice over spagnolo sat by the presidents bedside in the morning for the next two weeks watching tv and listening to his stories there was no mention of politics spagnolo day nine tuesday april 7th i went to the presidents room and spoke with him for 10 to 15 minutes he looked better and his spirits were good he continued to tell me various stories at that time about his early days in hollywood wallace months later the reagans invited the medical team to the oval office to thank them for saving the presidents life reagan always said his recovery was miraculous dr spagnolo agrees spagnolo i certainly think somebody was watching over me all the time making sure that the thing was going well i certainly took any extra help that i could get from the good lord above end videotape wallace i spoke with nancy reagan this weekend and asked if she had a message for dr spagnolo she said please send him a big big thank you and thats it for today have a great week and well see you next fox news sunday content

gossipcop-903960,1,what has metoo actually changed what has metoo actually changed 12 may 2018 share save rebecca seales bbc news share save bbc the oscars the golden globes cannes film festival until 2017 they were tinsel towns glitziest backslapping forums now theyre its favourite protest events of course its down to metoo the campaign against sexual harassment and abuse that swept through hollywood last autumn and has since been googled in every country on earth in its current form the movement began with film executive harvey weinstein or rather with the dozens of women who accuse him of sexual harassment abuse or rape the new york times printed the first allegations on 5 october and the mogul was fired from his own company inside a week pandoras box was open harvey weinstein denies engaging in nonconsensual sex on 15 october actress alyssa milano suggested on twitter that anyone who had been sexually harassed or assaulted should reply to her tweet with me too to demonstrate the scale of the problem half a million people responded in the first 24 hours a barrage of allegations has since emerged against highprofile men in entertainment the media politics and tech many deny any wrongdoing the repercussions are still in flux but hollywoods power dynamics have undoubtedly shifted thats less obviously true in the world beyond and begs the question whats different for the millions of ordinary people who shared their own metoo stories are the currents of the movement visible in their lives too how far has the rallying cry been converted into realworld change testing times up whos been helped by those hollywood millions one initiative has made solid progress and spent solid millions in a bid to make things better on the ground the times up legal defense fund more than 300 actresses writers and directors launched the project on 1 january raising 21m 15m in just a month to fund legal assistance for people who suffer harassment abuse or assault at work the national womens law center nwlc in washington dc is fielding the considerable admin matching applicants with lawyers who can offer them free advice we have received more than 2700 requests for assistance from every state in the united states and there are more than 500 attorneys in the network who are ready to take on times up cases sharyn tejani director of the fund at the nwlc told the bbc the fund prioritises cases involving lowwage workers women in nontraditional jobs people of colour lgbtq people and people facing legal retaliation because they dared to speak out about sexual harassment said ms tejani tina tchen who jointly leads the funds legal aid efforts said the beneficiaries include construction workers prison guards and police officers adding there are men who have come forward too there are some men who have experienced sexual harassment and then there are some men who are calling for example on behalf of their wives or loved ones thats unlikely to raise surprise in some quarters sian brooke of the oxford internet institute who studies gender and sexism online says the fact that men are often victims of sexual violence was one of the most powerful takeaways from metoo one group can be given attention and be taken seriously with regards to allegations of rape without it taking any of the severity or weight away from another part of it she notes has metoo helped abuse survivors seek support from october to december 2017 calls to the rape abuse incest national network a us crisis hotline rose by 23 compared with the same period in 2016 some abuse survivors have cited metoo as a stressful influence saying it resurfaced the pain of their abuse others have reported feeling less alone saying it encouraged them to address past trauma by talking to loved ones counsellors or people with similar experiences bbc its brought the idea of sexual harassment and assault into the public consciousness ms brooke says even if the discussion around the movement is criticism you are still bringing about an awareness that this happens 1in6 is a los angelesbased nonprofit group that supports male sex abuse survivors the groups development and communications director meredith alling told the bbc that metoo had a rapid measurable impact on the number of men reaching out to them when the hashtag first went viral we saw a 110 increase in web traffic and a 103 increase in the use of our online helpline service between september and october 2017 and the trend has continued she said whats being done to create better workplaces in the us employers are considering how best to create a positive workplace culture in the wake of metoo ted bunch is a cofounder of a call to men a social activism group that promotes healthy respectful ways of being a man and says the group has noticed an increase in enquiries most notably we have seen an increase in corporations seeking to understand why sexual harassment in the workplace is so pervasive he says mr bunch believes problems can arise because the workplace is a microcosm of society in which men and boys are sometimes taught to view women as objects and of less value than men most men are not abusive he says but nearly all men have laughed at a sexist joke or objectified a woman in some way once you connect the dots and show men how the jokes they see as harmless actually validate and fuel more harmful behaviour they are quick to change bbc has the push to ditch bad work cultures spread beyond the us one british human resources consultant said she had been surprised by the lack of metooinspired queries we havent seen any spikes in the volume of training requests or the volume of training were recommending i dont think its had a significant impact said elaine howell hr manager at plushr we have clients in professional services manufacturing clients financial marketing it appears to be quite specific to that industry entertainment speak to equity the 43000strong british actors union and its clear theyve had a different experience the union wont give exact figures but says its witnessed a significant increase in enquiries and case work since metoo vice president maureen beattie will take on equitys presidency this summer and shes keen to get the message out toxic behaviour will not go unpunished or as she puts it if you do something to one of our members which is wrong unacceptable were going to come after you and we will come after you bigtime these people havent gone away she says they are under a stone they are lurking just waiting for the time they think nobodys looking any more one of the things were doing is asking people who have been in the business for a long time people who are stars people who have clout to keep an eye out not that they have to be trained up in how to help somebody whos been sexually harassed but they can say with impunity and no danger of never being worked with again excuse me you cant behave like that with people how does an online movement secure an offline legacy the metoo most of us know is still a newish creation but it had a life before the viral hashtag in 2006 black activist tarana burke founded the movement as an initiative to unite survivors of sexual violence since it morphed from a lowkey project into a global byword she has embraced metoos alist flagbearers but her focus is on lasting change at all levels of society bbc one of her most telling remarks came the week before she walked the red carpet at the 2017 oscars if we keep on making statements and not really doing the work we are going to be in trouble sarah j jackson a professor of communication studies at northeastern university believes context is the key to anchoring me too i wouldnt call hashtag me too a movement at all she says i would call it a campaign that is part of a larger movement so i would call womens rights the movement and feminism the movement and i would say metoo is one indication of the sort of conversations that need to happen the next step is ok so now we know the problem how do we as a global community expand this conversation through its me too rising project google has charted how awareness spread around the world while data shows the term has been searched for in every corner of the planet its resonance has inevitably been greater in some countries than others the freedom of a nations press and social media can certainly have impact on that and its too soon to tell how the movement will shape countries where its gained traction more slowly japan and south korea for example karuna nundy a prominent lawyer in indias supreme court shared her view on metoos relevance to india where outrage over sex crimes has sparked waves of public protests in recent years the metoo conversations in india are limited to a swathe of englishspeaking internetenabled people its quite a lot in absolute numbers but small for india its added though to the huge conversations that were already happening the idea that due process is failing women and civil disobedience can be legitimate bbc ms nundy who helped draft indias tougher antirape law in 2013 says victims are now more likely to be believed i had a rape case yesterday against a leading bollywood producer my client is a very young woman we told the court that she was raped over a period of six months on pain of bodily harm regardless of what the court decides i think the way we were heard by the chief justice of the supreme court and the two judges is very different from the way we would have been heard say 15 years ago theres an interplay between public consciousness and the law and due process and thats exactly what i think is happening perhaps then metoo is not an endgame but a clarion call to something bigger a reminder for people to seek change in their communities and push to make damaging systems better especially for those who lack the power to fight alone there is information and support available for anyone affected by sexual abuse

politifact15379,0,it begins california appoints first illegal alien to state office trump has better plan illegal aliens residing in the state of california in defiance of federal immigration laws would now be able to serve on all state and local boards and commissions under a proposal introduced before the california state senate now the state of california has appointed its first unprotected illegal alien in state office after senate president pro tem kevin de len dlos angeles appointed lizbeth mateo an advisory committee the committees formal name is a bureaucratic mouthful the california student opportunity and access program project grant advisory committee or calsoap for short but its mission is one that will be familiar to mateo to find ways to help students from underserved communities go to college mateo is aa 33yearold attorney and civil rights activist who was born in mexico and came to the united states illegally at the age of 14 with her parents who are also illegal aliens according to the sacramento bee she often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government as a result she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice mateo said via fox news while undocumented students have become more visible in our state they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made trending melania just fired them all that is not acceptable here i wont allow it senate bill 174 made mateos appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status california law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment california is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents and opening state and local boards and commissions to every

politifact3919,1,rule by rentiers the new york times while the ostensible reasons for inflicting pain keep changing however the policy prescriptions of the pain caucus all have one thing in common they protect the interests of creditors no matter the cost deficit spending could put the unemployed to work but it might hurt the interests of existing bondholders more aggressive action by the fed could help boost us out of this slump in fact even republican economists have argued that a bit of inflation might be exactly what the doctor ordered but deflation not inflation serves the interests of creditors and of course theres fierce opposition to anything smacking of debt relief who are these creditors im talking about not hardworking thrifty small business owners and workers although it serves the interests of the big players to pretend that its all about protecting little guys who play by the rules the reality is that both small businesses and workers are hurt far more by the weak economy than they would be by say modest inflation that helps promote recovery no the only real beneficiaries of pain caucus policies aside from the chinese government are the rentiers bankers and wealthy individuals with lots of bonds in their portfolios and that explains why creditor interests bulk so large in policy not only is this the class that makes big campaign contributions its the class that has personal access to policy makers many of whom go to work for these people when they exit government through the revolving door the process of influence doesnt have to involve raw corruption although that happens too all it requires is the tendency to assume that whats good for the people you hang out with the people who seem so impressive in meetings hey theyre rich theyre smart and they have great tailors must be good for the economy as a whole but the reality is just the opposite creditorfriendly policies are crippling the economy this is a negativesum game in which the attempt to protect the rentiers from any losses is inflicting much larger losses on everyone else and the only way to get a real recovery is to stop playing that game

politifact8621,1,obamacare vs the catholic bishops i recently completed a very short interview on vatican radio to discuss the current battle between the obama administration and the united states conference of catholic bishops it didnt permit me to say more than that the obama administration is making a political mistake so id like to say a bit more about the serious consequences that will likely result and how we ended up with this churchstate conundrum in the first place as dr donald condit has already explained the obama administration seems to be making a political calculation that this controversy will blow over before the novembers presidential election because the conscience exemption for providing and paying for abortion sterilization and contraception will not take effect until later next year but the miscalculation was predictable and is now evident with not only catholics but orthodox evangelical jewish and other religious leaders taking a stand unless the administration relents or the obamacare law is ruled unconstitutional catholic hospitals and other institutions will be faced with a choice between not providing insurance coverage to their employees and thereby being fined by the government or pay for the provision of services that they believe are morally evil a journalist friend in rome just raised an alternative reading of the story to me on the street what if obama is actually making a principled argument that abortion sterilization and contraception services are a fundamental aspect of womens health that cannot and should not be denied to anyone regardless of their own religious or individual convictions perhaps the white house believes as most progressives do that these stodgy uptight opponents will eventually inevitably be overcome and we will one day wonder what all the fuss about if so the administration is doing much more than thinking about the next election its redefining what the word health means to include measures that violently take away life from the most innocent and vulnerable persons regardless of who pays for the services this makes it much more than a religious freedom or a conscience issue and a matter of simple justice more generally the whole obamacare mess is a result of employerprovided health insurance we would all be better off if our health insurance was decoupled from our employment and we were free to purchase our own insurance according to our needs and wants it is a result of state intervention in the economy namely wageandprice controls that led to employers offering health insurance as a nonwage benefit to entice desired employees to their companies now we have the government mandating that all employers must provide comprehensive coverage to all their employees what was once a prudential individual decision has become a governmentmandated right that trumps the employeremployee the doctorpatient and perhaps even the priestpenitent relationship some progress there is some tragic irony to all this we should not forget that many religious leaders have longsupported increasing the role of the state in health care and the economy atlarge perhaps thinking that conscience clauses would protect their institutions against any undue interference well they were wrong what the state giveth the state taketh away if you invite the state to assist more and more of your activities it will eventually start telling you how to do things encouraging the democratic partys efforts from harry truman on to socialize the healthcare system of the united states is likely to have dire consequences for catholic and other religiousbased social service providers economic ignorance among religious leaders comes at a very high cost to their own good works

the kremlin well ask our sunday panel where this takes the expanding probe into russian interference plus president trump returns from his first trip overseas to a domestic agenda in trouble from obamacare repeal and replace to the budget some on capitol hill wonder whether congress will pass anything sen lindsey graham rsouth carolina yes definitely dead on arrival sen dick durbin dillinois this is step backwards youre not going to make america great again with this budget wallace well break down the presidents priorities and prospects with a number two democrat in the senate dick durbin and republican senator dr bill cassidy and our power player of the week flying high for the blue angels unidentified male boy is it sweet when we put all that together and get that synergy and you feel that fuzz wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again on this memorial day weekend from fox news in washington president trump is back at the white house arriving late last night after a largely successful nineday trip to the middle east and europe but he returns to a spreading scandal about links between the kremlin and some of his current and former advisors and to a domestic agenda that stalled in congress well get to all of that this hour but we begin with terror that suicide bombing at a concert in manchester england that killed 22 just the first of four savage attacks this week around the world joining us now the man in charge of keeping america safe the secretary of homeland security general john kelly mr secretary welcome to fox news sunday before we get to terror let me ask you about the hot story in washington now these revelations about jared kushner trying to set up a back channel to the kremlin through the soviet and the russian ambassador your reaction to that is there anything improper with that kelly well i dont know if its true or not i know its being its being reported in the press wallace it has been confirmed to me the conversation took place kelly ok then i would just tell you chris that i think any channel of communications back or otherwise with a country like russia is a good thing i mean multiple ways to communicate back and forth is a good thing with a country i think and particularly a country thats like russia so it doesnt it doesnt bother me i mean you just have to assume obviously that what youre getting is may or may not be true they may be working you but thats the whole point i mean that communication goes into the white house as a data point in terms of discussion so i dont see the big deal wallace let me you say you dont see a big deal kelly no i think any time you have channels of communication with a country particularly one like russia i wouldnt criticize it wallace but you talked about a data point into the white house this is during the transition kelly right wallace these were private officials kelly right wallace we have one president at a time does that make a difference kelly you know i mean obviously during the transition period the people in transition the incoming trump administration is not in a position to do anything to inhibit with the obama administration literally days before they transitioned out so again as they begin to build relationships theres nothing wrong with that as they begin to build their own situational awareness with russia in this case i dont see an issue here wallace ok lets turn to your day job whats the latest on the manchester bombing have they rolled up the network that was supporting the bombers and what have you learned from this plot that will help you better protect the us homeland kelly i mean i dont know what the actually the better way to put it i cant comment on whether they finish their investigations or roll you know completed rolling up on the network that were dealing with but i would just say that this is yes ive said it many times it really is a generational struggle this is one tragedy in line with dozens of other tragedies in the world i mean last week you had manchester you had egypt you had indonesia you had the philippines all isisinspired or isiscontrolled terrorist attack wallace was there something different about this network and the way this was pulled off that says to you gee weve got to up our game kelly well its this kind of in my view theres kind of three types of terrorist attacks the most sophisticated that we look at that is against aviation thats the hardest to do but its the biggest payoff for these people then you have kind of the middle of the road one which i think this one was its a network its hard to do you have to construct a bomb and all and then you have kind of the lowend where i mean just as tragic but you have people running people over in trucks that kind of thing but this is just the way terrorism is today and i think it will be around for many many years to come you know the good news is those officials in the united kingdom europe around the world are relentless they are just as relentless in terms of trying to prevent these things as the terrorists arent trying to create them the good news is for our country we have not had an outside the united states terrorist attacks since 911 and that goes to the issue of those that fight our away game thats dod nsa cia and those that fight the home game thats dhs fbi local law enforcement wallace let me pick up on this because part of the story this week was the leak of information about the bomber and the bombing that made its way into the us media and that set off this exchange begin video clip theresa may british prime minister i made clear to president trump that the intelligence that is shared between our law enforcement agencies must remain secure rex tillerson secretary of state we take full responsibility for that and we obviously regret that that happened end video clip wallace how was this kind of sensitive information leaked to the new york times and general why is it that whether its politics or terror our intelligence agencies our law enforcement agencies cant keep a secret kelly its outrageous when i call immediately after the attack i called my counterpart in uk offered my condolences by the way the third time ive offered her amber rudd my condolences in 120 days thats how frequent this kind of these terrorist attacks are happening anyways she rightfully and very graciously accepted the condolences and leaned into me on this leak its outrageous i dont know why people do it it jeopardizes not only investigations it puts peoples lives in jeopardy i dont why people do it but they do and thats the world we live in wallace lets get to what youre going to try to do to protect the homeland there are a lot of crowded events in the summer concerts sporting events how do you harden these soft targets like this concert and do you have new thoughts because this person didnt get into the event he was outside the event what do you do about parameters kelly we one of the great things about america theres many great things but we are a free and open society and in many and i wouldnt change that at all but thats also one of our vulnerabilities people can live their lives day in and day out privacy issues all of that its a good thing its what america is all about but as i say that is a vulnerability the good news is to all americans i mean the good news is that local state law enforcement today not to even go down the issue of the fbi dhs its in their dna now to harden we are just about as hard as we can be i dont know if theres a way to prevent these kinds of things in the kind of society we live in wallace let me pick up on that because i want to play a clip of your testimony before congress this week here it is begin video clip kelly its everywhere and thats you know thats the nature of this threat that we are dealing with as horrible as manchester was my expectation is were going to see a lot more of that kind of attack end video clip wallace a lot more of that kind of attack here in the us kelly i think were relatively we have no specific we have threats all the time but no right now specific threat but that goes to the fact that we are over here and not over there the fact is that its the caliphate is being destroyed that is syria and iraq there are large numbers of returning fighters western europe and you know in many cases like this guy that did this thing in manchester hes a citizen of the uk in this case hes a passport holder i dont if the uk had any idea that he was outside that he was in libya but i think hes also traveled to other points the point is they have a real threat and its growing its metastasized as fighters come back from the caliphate to be i believe to be more of this kind of thing the good news is all decent people all decent governments and it doesnt matter whether we are politically close to them or not all governments for the most part are sharing tremendous amounts of information passporttype information aviation travel information but you know people like this are below the radar wallace i want to pick up on aviation because you are in the process of making some big decisions on aviation and i want to do a lightning round quick questions quick answers are you going to ban laptops from the cabin on all international flights both into and out of the us kelly i might thats a quick answer wallace yes well expand a little bit kelly well theres a real threat numerous threats against aviation thats really the thing that they are obsessed with the terrorists the idea of knocking down an airplane in flight particularly if its a us carrier particularly if its full of mostly us folks people its real you know that i implemented i think on the 21st of march a restriction on large electronic devices in the cabins from ten points of origin wallace right but there was talk as you say about all international flights both into and out of the us when you say you might when are you going to make that decision and whats going to determine it kelly inaudible follow the intelligence the very very good news is that we are working incredibly close with friends and partners around the world were going to and in the process of defining this but we are going to raise the bar for generally speaking aviation security much higher than it is now so and theres new technologies down the road not too far down the road that we will rely on but it is a real sophisticated threat and i will reserve that decision until we see where its going wallace another lightning round question i do need a quick answer here because were running of time the tsa is testing tighter screening of carryons and the idea that people who bring their carryons are going to have to unpack them and put food in one bin and electronics in the another bin and paper in another bin are you going to spread that nationwide and whats that going to do to the screening lines kelly yes i mean the reason weve done tsa of course works for me the reason weve done that is because of people trying to avoid the 25 or 50 or whatever it is to check a bag are now stuffing your carryon bags to the point of you know well they cant get any more in there so the more you stuff in there the less the tsa professionals that are looking at whats in those bags through the monitors they cant tell whats in the bags anymore so if you put wallace so are you going to do that nationwide kelly we might and likely will wallace soon kelly well what were doing now is working out the tactics techniques and procedures if you will in a few airports to find out exactly how to do that with the least amount of inconvenience to the traveler wallace a couple final questions i want to ask about the travel ban the fourth circuit court of appeals issued a ruling this week continuing the stay on president trumps revised travel ban and i want to put up the chief judge called it the revised travel ban an executive order that in text speaks with vague words of national security but in context drips with religious intolerance animus and discrimination mr secretary judge after judge has said that this is a muslim man that violates the constitution kelly they are dead wrong wallace well i mean you say that but they are the ones who were kelly they are wrong remember the seven now six countries these were the same countries identified by the obama administration that we should be extra cautious about and backed up you know by the united states congress thats where those seven countries came from the fact is that in those countries we have very little ability to actually verify vet the people that are coming out of those countries so what the president and its not a travel ban remember its the travel pause what the president said for 90 days we were going to pause in terms of people from those countries coming to the united states that would give me time to look at additional vetting to see wallace ok i want to pick up on that and why youre even talking about the travel ban because i want to put some numbers on take a look at this the first executive order that was issued on january 27th banned citizens from seven nations from entering the us for 90 days suspended the refugee program for 120 days as you say a pause while you set up an extreme vetting program its now been 121 days since that first order so why dont you have the program in place kelly we are actually implementing it the irony here is had it stood we would have had the 90 days to study were not even studying what would be procedures because we are enjoined and cant do that in the meantime wallace you cant study extreme vetting kelly no were the irony again is we cant study it but im just guessing and implementing but we are going to find implement ways to determine who this an individual is and remember most of these countries have no passports they have no police they have no intelligence many of the countries in question dont even have a us embassy there to help us vet the un will tell you its almost impossible to vet these people from these countries because there are no passports and all the rest of it we have to figure out a way to determine who they are and why they come into the united states otherwise were guessing and this president and john kelly doesnt want to guess when it comes to national security and protection of the us population wallace secretary kelly thank you thanks for sharing part of your holiday weekend with us kelly absolutely thanks wallace up next new reports that jared kushner attempted to set up a back channel between russia and the trump transition well bring in our sunday group to discuss the expanding russia probe plus what would you like to ask the panel about the continuous leaks in washington just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip hillary clinton dformer presidential candidate we were furious about the past presidential election of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice end video clip wallace hillary clinton talking about richard nixon in her commencement speech at wellesley college but clearly taking a shot at president trump by the way nixon resigned before he was actually impeached and its time now for our sunday group the head of heritage action for america michael needham charles lane of the washington post gerald seib from the wall street journal and national security council staffer gillian turner and just to catch you up president trump returns home to reports that his soninlaw jared kushner met with the russian ambassador to the us sergey kislyak in december and that they discussed setting up a secret secure channel between the trump transition and the kremlin that communications link reportedly to be based in a russian diplomatic facility in russia a source close to the trump administration tells me the conversation did take place but he says it was the ambassador who proposed the back channel not kushner so the russian military could talk with trump advisors about the situation in syria and the source points out that the secure link was never set up so with that as a preface gerry your reaction to the kushner story and how does this complicate the already complicated investigation of links between the kremlin and the trump transition gerald f seib the wall street journal well look i mean back channels are not unusual they are not unprecedented this one might have seemed perfectly innocent two problems though with it one is this happened during the transition it seems to violate as you suggested earlier in the show the only one president at a time rule and the second one is its russia after a campaign in which the russian connection to the campaign the russian interference in the campaign was a big issue and i think the fact that it was at a time when people were looking for whether there were going to be signs of special favors for russia as a result of help they might have given president trump thenpresidentelect trump during the campaign thats what makes this a big story is the context of the conversation as much as the actual content wallace michael i want to ask you one whether its a big story and secondly about the talk we are hearing that is just rampant in washington today about major changes in the white house that theyre going to set up a rapid response operation to deal with all the incoming leaks that the president has hired at least one criminal defense lawyer and may be process of hiring a team and the staff is urging the president to let the lawyers vet his tweets i mean it really does sound like theyre going on a war footing on this michael needham ceo heritage action for america yes i dont know if its a major story there are several investigations going on they probably should be allowed to work their course its kind of exhausting reading some of these new stories and trying to figure out what did you read three weeks ago thats just being recycled versus what new i think its smart for the administration to try to put this stuff to the side have you know a team that looks at these issues and another team that looks at a lot of real policy issues which are closer to the american people you have the most conservative exciting budget thats come out in a decade wallace were going to get to the agenda in the next segment crosstalk wallace i mean at the very least it seems dumb needham clearly the optics of these are awful and i think that especially when you have people who are new to the political system coming in and getting advice from a guy in mike flynn who probably didnt show the best judgment through a lot of this you know dumb might be a good word for it i dont know you know i think kushner said a couple of weeks ago that he was happy to participate with the senate investigation he said hes happy to participate with this investigation you are at a disadvantage when you are the focus of an investigation and your lawyers are saying dont participate dont comment and everyone else in the country seems more than eager to talk about it so i think a little prudence in keeping our mouth shut while we let the investigations play out is probably fair and well see what comes up in them wallace you talk about the fact that theyre all the stories and sometimes its hard to remember what youve heard this week and what you heard last week and this gets to the question of leaks i asked our staff to put together lets put it up on the screen a list of the headlines from just the last two weeks this is just sunday two weeks ago until today and as you can see theres been a torrent of disclosures from intelligence and law enforcement officials gillian as somebody who worked in the government have you ever seen anything like this and you know the conservatives talk about a deep state that there are people embedded in law enforcement and embedded in the intelligence community that are trying to bring this president down it sure seems like its true gillian turner former white house national security council so to me on the question of leaks it seems that without a doubt leaks of information today are the number one threat to us national security interest across the globe and i think for evidence of that we need look no further than the very public reprimand we the united states had to endure from britain earlier this week in the wake of the manchester attacks a reminder that the britishus intelligence cooperation relationship is one of the closest that has ever existed and in my lifetime in government and policy i have not seen something so public so public a risk ph crosstalk wallace most of these leaks arent about national security they are about trumps political security turner yes and so this gets to the question of the deep state so im somebody who likes to push back against the narrative having been a civil servant in the government again in the national security community is different than the political community the rest of the policy community but i will say that from i have seen and experienced it does not exist there is not this liberal wallace how do you define this turner there isnt a liberal core of people put it this way chris for a hard fact more than 50 percent of the federal workforce today is made up of people that joined the government prior to president bushs tenure in office so the idea that these are obama holdovers is simply not true its not the case i think that when we talk about why individuals leak information the explanations are as varied as human beings psychology so for example a lot of things we are seeing leaked about the president are probably being leaked by his senior staff to hurt one another thats not unique to the trump administration wallace we ask you for questions for the panel and we got some different reactions in this question of leaks adri ane sent us on facebook do whistleblowers hold a vital role in the health of a democracy holding those in power to accountability but chuck coo had a different take simple question if our intelligence agencies are as good as advertised why cant they find the leakers chuck how do you answer both of them about leaks charles lane the washington post well as a member of the press and is a believer in the role of the media and holding government accountable im not going to come out against leaks because you know for all the leaks that may cause this or that official trouble theres going to be another one that does play an important role in accountability but going back to what gillian said i think part of the reason that these leaks are flowing so uncontrollably to the viewers question is the factional struggle within this administration you know we have this famous dispute between bannon and kushner that supposedly was papered over but i wouldnt be surprised if you know those were present two currents to put it politely within the white house that are trying to get bad stories out about one another and this goes to your point about the staff shakeup and so on and so forth you can shake up the staff all you want but if man at the top is not laying out a clear and consistent line is not himself modeling behavior for example by not blowing an israeli source in a meeting with a foreign government that sets the tone that this stuff is not really on then it will continue needham i take your point about the responsibility of the press and how leaks play into as it requires a responsible press also that when james fallows of the atlantic today put sidebyside the washington post in the new york times and how they treat i think it was three unnamed sources in the white house talking about jared kushner and his desire to be here and stay here this is not an urgent story this is not something thats getting out there i dont think you see in the press the times and the washington post the way they are playing this kind of using leakers to try to unearth the truth and taking two months like crosstalk wallace we need to needham its kind of getting ridiculous wallace we need to because were going to run out of time let me simply say were just receiving information its people who had sworn oftentimes taken legal oaths not to divulge the information they are the ones putting it out were just the recipients all right we have to take a break here well see you a little later when we come back senators dick durbin and bill cassidy is the presidents agenda both his new budget and the new effort to repeal and replace obamacare in trouble commercial break wallace coming up president trump releases his budget begin video clip donald trump president of the united states my administration is laying a foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve american greatness end video clip wallace but does it have any chance of getting through congress two key senators join us next commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway of the indianapolis motor speedway home to this weekends indianapolis 500 back from his first foreign trip president trumps focus will now shift to his domestic agenda his new budget and a bill to repeal and replace obamacare joining us to discuss the presidents priorities from springfield illinois the senates number two democrat dick durbin and here in washington louisiana senator and doctor bill cassidy whos on both the senate finance and health committees well senators before we get to the trump agenda ive got to ask you about the big story in washington this weekend the jared kushner story discussions about setting up a possible back channel with russia senator durbin whats wrong with that sen dick durbin dillinois the bottom line of course is we now have a special counsel in bob mueller i have the highest level of confidence in him and i hope that he will follow all the evidence all the leads and all the suggestions and im sure he will wallace do you have any specific comment about the kushner conversation and whether or je should keep his security clearance durbin well of course not i mean this is a rumor at this point and whether it is something that should be followed up on ill trust bob muellers judgment wallace senator cassidy are you troubled by this sen bill cassidy rlouisiana i agree with dicks assessment and ill say when you speak to folks back home voters across the nation theyre more concerned about their climbing health care premiums and the need to have jobs with better wages and better benefits this will play out we will know eventually right now americans need help with their premiums wallace well you know what then gentlemen lets switch to health care and the congressional budget office nonpartisan released its score of the house bill this week and lets put the numbers up on the screen it would reduce the deficit 119 billion over ten years but 23 million more people would be uninsured by 2026 the cost of insurance according to the cbo for a 64yearold earning 27000 a year would increase from 1700 a year under obamacare to more than 13000 under the gop bill heres what senate democratic leader chuck schumer said this week begin video clip sen chuck schumer dny minority leader unless youre a healthy millionaire trumpcare is a nightmare this report ought to be the final nail in the coffin of the republican effort to sabotage our health care system end video clip wallace senator cassidy is schumer right cassidy so the senate will write its own bill and it shouldnt be the final coffin because right now theres families sitting around their kitchen table theyre play 20000 30000 and 40000 a year for premiums and theres about to be a 40 percent increase in many states in these premiums cassidycollins a bill ive introduced with susan collins we have four cosponsors wallace yes were going to get into that in a cassidy but that said actually would would would meet that familys needs and i think it should be a place we go and those families are asking us to address those issues wallace so so what would you say to americans how should they regard the house bill cassidy the house product the senate will have its own product we will go to conference but i think the senate product im hopeful will be more likely to address their needs wallace senator durbin i know what youre going to say and the cbo certainly indicates there are problem with repeal and replace but obamacare has its own problems you heard senator cassidy mentioned some of them blue cross blue shield of kansas city just announced this week that it has lost 100 million through 2016 and that it is going to pull out of exchanges that means that in 25 counties in western missouri they may have no insurer at all doesnt something have to be done dramatically durbin well it should be but first we ought to have an administration that supports our health care system what the trump administration has done since day one is to find ways to cut off support for our current health care system lack of advertising for example to bring new people on board so we have larger insurance pools and lower premiums we have to have an effort made to sustain the current system while we repair it we shouldnt be sabotaging it wallace wait wait wait wait senator durbin but lets look at the bottom line here what the republicans wallace senator durbin let me just point out when blue cross blue shield of kansas city says theyve lost 100 million in 2016 you cant blame that on trump he wasnt president durbin no of course it is not a situation where the system we have is perfect and it isnt i voted for it and it needs to be repaired and i think bill cassidy and susan collins are at least willing to sit down in a constructive fashion and deal with that bill and i have had conversations about that im sorry that the two of them are not in the room with the 13 apostles that senator mcconnells chosen to come up with the republicans plan i wish bill and susan were in there wallace all right let let let me bring senator cassidy back because lets talk about the collins susan collins the republican senator from maine and cassidy plan and here are some of the highlights of that plan keep most obamacare taxes to pay for a replacement instead of an individual mandate that would end auto enroll people in insurance so they have to opt out not opt in and let states keep most of obamacare if they want senator its a very interesting plan but i dont have to tell you there are some of your more conservative colleagues in the senate who are never going to go for this because theyre cassidy thats wallace i mean theyre already upset that they say the house plane leaves too much of obamacare in place youre leaving more of it in place cassidy a couple things it is the conservative solution the conservative thinks the power should return to individuals and to states we do that the power that obamacare gave took from states we give back and you cant say youre a conservative and we believe in states rights and then tell states what they cant do if a blue state wishes to do a blue thing god bless them and as regard to taxes it isnt so much that we have to keep these taxes as a fiscal conservative i do think we need to pay for things we have to balance our budget we just say those taxes should be addressed in comprehensive tax reform not piecemealed beforehand i will repeat the cassidycollins plan is the conservative solution wallace but have you gotten any buyin and let me just take a few names from ted cruz from rand paul from mike lee and what are the chances honestly that the senate wont pass anything that this health care reform is going to die cassidy i cant speak for those senators you listed i will say that between aside from susan and i theres four other republicans who support it now what would really be wallace thats six you need 44 more cassidy but of all the plants out there were the one that have the most support and there are others who are very much interested but ill also say to my friend dick durbin if we had democrats involved because we do allow a blue state to do a blue thing thats states rights that if they cant if we had 25 democrats and 40 republicans it wouldnt be a republican plan it wouldnt be a democratic plan it would be an american plan wallace ok let me quickly because i want to get to the budget briefly but but real quickly senator durbin any democratic buyin durbin as long as we take repeal off the table there are a lot of democrats who want to bring a chair to the table im one of them lets sit down together with bill cassidy and susan collins i dont agree with their many aspects of their startup plan but its a good faith effort to do two things reduce the cost of health insurance and expand the reach of health insurance that should be our national goal wallace all right now theres the trump budget that was released this week and lets go through some of the highlights of that here are some of the key increases in spending for the military increase by 101 percent border security by 68 percent but epa is cut 314 percent the state department by 291 percent and nih the national institutes of health by 182 percent heres how trump budget director mick mulvaney explained it begin video clip mick mulvaney director office of management and budget compassion needs to be on both sides of that equation yes you have to have compassion for folks who are receiving the federal funds but also you have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it end video clip wallace senator durbin i know youre going to bash the trump budget but but dont we have to cut spending at some point are we just going to keep piling up the national debt durbin well thats a very very important question that you asked chris but the question is where you cut it and how you cut i do not believe you make america great again by cutting medical research to the lowest level in 12 years i dont think you make america great again by saying to working families its now more expensive for your kids to borrow money for student loans you certainly dont make us a great nation by cutting back in infrastructure all those three things are in the trump budget so if were going to have priorities lets look at the things that are important for building jobs and opportunity in the future wallace senator cassidy how dead i know its dead but how dead is the trump budget cassidy so class typically in fact always the senate and the house write their own budget but it does reflect the presidents goals i actually agree with those goals but would take a different approach lets speak of medicaid which under their budget is cut medicaid is unsustainable both for states and for the federal government it has to be reformed but as a physician who worked with medicaid patients i know that benefit has to also be preserved ive actually worked on legislation that would bend the cost curve at the same time reform it so that states would not go bankrupt trying to continue their medicaid program wallace but cassidy we have elements of that in the cassidycollins plan we share the goal we just have a different way to get there wallace but just real quickly though i know youre concerned about the gulf coast and louisiana are you ok with cutting epa youre a doctor are you ok with these kinds of big cuts in nih cassidy again i think the best way to control future health care spending is to find that cure for alzheimers i agree with the goal i have a different approach if we find a cure for alzheimers which postpones or heals then those folks are not taking a trillion dollars out of our economy with their illness rather they are contributing that capital is used for something else we can actually get at this in a different light wallace senator cassidy senator durbin i want to thank you both for coming in and thank you for your time especially in this holiday weekend cassidy thank you wallace up next president trump wraps up his first foreign trip but his troubles here at home havent gone away our panel comes back to discuss both commercial break begin video clip trump we made extraordinary gains on this historic trip to advance the security and prosperity of the united states our friends and our allies end video clip wallace president trump at the end of his first foreign trip giving himself good reviews which is what presidents always do and were back now with the panel gillian how do you think the president did on this trip and why do you think he seemed to get along so much better with the leaders in the middle east than he did with our allies in europe turner so i really divide the trip into two parts conceptually its helpful so the first is really going around and touching on major worlds the worlds major three religions excuse me chris christianity judaism and islam and i think that that part of the trip went relatively well we had some pushback from the media about certain protocol optics like you know like what was donning the heads of melania and ivanka trump thats fine i think the second part of the trip was really natofocused and there the presidents speech actually got a lot of criticism but i think for the first time the administration cabinetwide is actually striking the right tone on nato by which i mean theyre focusing on recommitting themselves to the importance of the alliance and they backtracked or progressed however you want to phrase it on the the idea that its become obsolete which is a good thing for everyone at the same time theyre encouraging the member nations to contribute 2 percent gdp which at this time remember this was part of the presidents campaign platform so i think hes got a mandate from the american people to push for that and its something hes doing i think its a nice balance wallace we should point out that the first part of the trip especially the saudi part of the trip was largely organized by jared kushner and people who support him say he was talking to all of those saudi leaders and helping and sunni muslim leaders during the transition and thats one of the reasons it was such a success chuck what struck you about these nine days lane i have to say the chilly atmospherics of the europe portion of the trip in contrast to the warmth the abundant good feeling that was on display in saudi arabia between the president and the royal family of saudi arabia that that contrast i think spoke volumes its true that hes the president got a lot of criticism for not uttering the words i personally support article five the mutual defense guarantee in nato wallace attack on one is an attack on all lane correct but the reason for another president with another history who had run a different campaign that wouldnt be an issue the europeans feel very embattled and nervous with respect to the trump administration he supported brexit he openly spoke warmly about marine le pen hes called nato obsolete and they were looking for some the kind of reassurance that he gave the saudis and they didnt get it and i think that will have repercussions going forward wallace lets talk about the domestic side because the president returns to a congress that is addley ph divided about repeal and replace and has already both republicans and democrats rejected his budget that we were just talking about with the two senators michael some senate republicans are talking about just giving up on health care and moving straight tax reform needham it would be a mistake i mean the american health care system is collapsing under obamacare but part of the reason that this agenda is so complicated and that we need a real sense of urgency on both the white house and the congress about health care tax reform the budget the debt limit all this stuff thats coming up and how it fits together is that for seven years the republican party has told itself a lie that we are all united on wanting the same ends that we all want to repeal obamacare its about what the replace is and what you actually have is you have very legitimate and heartfelt disagreement within the party about what the best path forward is some conservatives who want to focus on title one regulations bill cassidy who has his plan the tuesday group in the house which is more of a force wallace more moderate needham the moderate group kind of a force for the status quo i think the healthiest thing thats happened in the last couple of months is that in the house for the first time leadership and the members themselves acknowledge that there are real differences of policy in this party this isnt good guys and bad guys it isnt disagreements about tactics they sat down for a couple of weeks they understood where they were coming from and they came up with a coalition form of government that said you know what lets let the state decides if they want to wave out of obamacare thats fine for some of them and others dont wallace but but needham thats the model that needs that needs to happen going forward to bring them together wallace but but the problem of course with that as you just heard from bill cassidy is hes saying theyre basically going to put that over the side maybe theyll take a little bit out of it but theyre going to write their own bill gerry is it possible that we could get to the end of 2017 this year and that a republicancontrolled congress republican control of the house and the senate will not have passed a single major trump legislative initiative and if so what does that mean for prospects for republicans in the 2018 midterms seib well it is first of all it is possible because were staring down the path here of no easy wins you know no big easy wins by the way theres one other that you shouldnt forget which is by the fall this congress has to raise the debt ceiling which everybody hates to do and and wallace youve also got to fund the government seib you have to fund the government have to raise the debt ceiling theyre going to have to get republican votes conservatives hate raising the debt ceiling everybody hates raising the debt ceiling that has to happen as well so you have a whole series of tough or unpleasant choices before the congress my guess is that in the end i think a republican congress will figure out a way to get together and get some of these things done even in a truncated form because its too heavy a lift to go through an entire year in full control of the government and not have anything to show for it wallace you think they pass tax health care reform or do you think theyre going to end up eventually realizing you had mitch mcconnell say i dont see how we get to 50 seib yes wallace which is not the kind of thing he openly says do you think that they could just punt on that and go to tax reform seib i think they could easily walk past health and go to tax reform i mitch mcconnells a smart guy hes not going to move down a path unless he knows theres success at the end of that path and if he doesnt you know thats because there is no way to get 50 votes plus one i do think tax reform is something that republicans really want to do theyve come to washington to cut taxes theyre not going to walk out of this town i think in december without having given that at least a really good try wallace michael needham yes no i think you know they need to do both and all of these things are intertwined at some point they have to sit down and look at these various points the debt limit spending tax reform health care and define which wings of the party which different factions within the parties will get what wins where and once they do that theyll get some the other thing that has to be considered this week is is the paris accords paris climate treaty and what makes that so complicated i think for the president is its nonbinding i think hes actually going to come out this week and pull out the paris accords he made an explicit promise on the campaign trail hes somebody who likes to keep his promises and second the united states shouldnt stay in a treaty just because its nonbinding if we dont intend on participating we should pull out i think the president will do that wallace all right we have to leave here thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the blue angels flying high and inspiring pride commercial break wallace soldiers placing flags by the 230000 grave markers at arlington national cemetery pride professionalism precision those are the watchwords of this military unit and on this special weekend that unit is our power player of the week begin videotape ryan bernacchi blue angels commanding officer were focused on that very precise control of the airplane and flying it to the very best of your ability and youre thinking out ahead ok whats next and whats next and whats next wallace voiceover ryan bernacchi is commander of the blue angels the navys precision flight squadron hes in the number one jet leading his team through intricate maneuvers at up to 700 miles per hour with the planes sometimes just 18 inches apart the blue angels were in the area to perform at the us naval academy and we got to go inside their operation wallace on camera is there a lot of talking going on while youre up in the air bernacchi there is a lot of talking as the leader im calling acadence ph for every every turn every pull every power change and were just going to turn left its as simple as coming left and on that go all six sticks will move in unison coming further left a little pull inaudible and when all that gets going we call it we call it fuzz it gets fuzzy because it will it will just take on this rhythm youre feeling the fuzz chris yes wallace im feeling the fuzz bernacchi yes its something its its its crisp but its its electric wallace voiceover admiral chester nimitz started the blue angels in 1946 with f6 hellcat prop planes to keep up interest in naval aviation after world war ii now they fly f18 hornets in dozens of shows each year for more than 11 million spectators from a cloudy naval academy to a crystal clear san francisco bay bernacchi i always was going to be a pilot wallace on camera why bernacchi the blue angels wallace voiceover bernacchi used to go with his dad to shows in the bay area every summer bernacchi i was that kid and i wanted to fly wallace now he has a nickname bernacchi they call the flight leader boss wingmen will talk to me and hey boss you know and thats the way it it works and then we we do it on the ground as well wallace at the end of the show the blue angels do a maneuver called a loop break cross all six planes headed straight up then in six different directions and then back to the center point bernacchi at about 800 knots of closure so just under 1000 miles an hour and boy is it is it sweet when we put all that together that that synergy and you feel that fuzz and you get it you get it going and and thats really really its its sweet but its very very intense wallace bernacchi whos flown combat over iraq and afghanistan compares it to operating off an aircraft carrier and he says thats the mission of the blue angels to represent their fellow service members who are on the front lines bernacchi its about the navy marine corps theyre forward deployed theyre theyre providing us with our freedom and thats the real work we makes people feel something and and its that pride its the pride this country has in our sailors and marines and we just bring it and display it in a way that people can connect with and they can they can see and feel and touch and that i think is the value of the blue angels end videotape wallace blue angels will be traveling the country this summer if you get a chance to see them in action its something you will never forget and thats it for today we hope youll take a moment this weekend to remember all the men and women who have given their lives defending our freedom and well see you next fox news sunday commercial break content and

gossipcop-901983,1,jennifer lopezs hot christmas in miami with alex rodriguez you cant buy your first tarot deck someone needs to give it to you i am sure you may have heard this old saying before and this is what has kept many people away from trying the tarot card you absolutely dont need to wait for someone else to start your tarot journey in this article we will bust this myth wide open and get you started on your path right now courtesy of viva luna studios on unsplash the origin of the gifted tarot deck myth so where did this strange rule come from nobody knows for sure but it likely started back when magical practices were kept secret teachers would pass down special tools only to students they chose as worthy the mystical idea caught on and a tarot deck passed from person to person carried special energy or power some say it started because the elites wanted to keep the tarot exclusive and only to themselves and on the other hand some people think it was about creating a sense of community but the fact is that it was never an actual rule and it was just a tradition that somehow got treated like law why this myth doesnt hold up today modern spirituality is all about taking charge of your own path waiting around for someone to decide youre ready for tarot makes zero sense but what if you dont know anyone who reads tarot should you just never start of course not this myth can actually be very harmful to the popularity of tarot card reading and it may even threaten the very existence of cards it suggests you need permission from others to begin your spiritual journey your spiritual path belongs to you and not to someone else who may or may not gift you a deck someday personal connection to your tarot deck matters more the deck you use should speak to you each tarot deck has its own artwork symbols and feel some show fantasy scenes others use anime styles and some may even stick to traditional images whereas others will update with modern themes when you are choosing your own deck you need to pick the one that clicks with your style maybe the colors grab you maybe the characters look friendly maybe the symbols make sense right away this personal bond helps your readings flow better from day one the cards become your friend and not strangers buying your own tarot deck is powerful buying your own deck can be a powerful moment as it says i trust my intuition it marks the start of your journey because you decided you were ready many readers report feeling an instant connection when they find their first deck maybe youll spot one that seems to glow on the shelf of a local shop or you might browse online until a particular set of cards makes your heart beat faster that moment of recognition thats your intuition already working selfselected decks often become favorites for years to come theres something special about a deck you choose yourself and it is the one that matched your energy from the very beginning and taking control of your path means saying yes to yourself instead of waiting for someone else to say yes to you buying your own deck is the first step in claiming your spiritual authority and thats very amazing how to choose the right tarot deck for yourself heres what to look for if you are ready to pick your own deck artwork pick a style that makes you happy you can pick bright colors or detailed drawings or even simple designs the images should feel good to look at guidebook you need to pay careful attention to the things that come along with the card one of the things that comes with it is the guidebook and this is usually very beginnerfriendly and good for those people who are new to tarot reading you can try reading the book before you start your reading cardstock and packaging hold the cards if possible and check if they are too big for your hands or too slippery or may be too stiff to shuffle the box matters too as it can protect your cards energy check trust your gut if a deck feels right for you then it probably is the important thing is that you connect and resonate with the deck that you use cleansing and bonding with a new tarot deck bought your own deck awesome now youll want to make it truly yours by cleansing it and connecting with it you can place it on your windowsill during a full moon tap each card gently to wake it up shuffle with the intent to connect your energy to the cards wrap it in a special cloth when not in use gem blackthorn notes purchased decks should be cleansed and programmed to your energy anyway so the gift thing doesnt even matter here what if you are gifted a tarot deck if you get a deck of tarot cards as a gift then it can be a wonderful experience you can most probably get it as a gift from someone you know and who knows the card you receive can even match with your personality and therefore provide you with a strong bonding but what if you get a deck you dont connect with it happens you can keep it on your shelf as part of your collection use it for specific types of readings thank the giver but still buy one you like better pass it along to someone else who might love it a gifted deck isnt magical just because it was given to you its the thought that counts not some mystical transfer of powers no you absolutely dont need to be gifted a tarot deck the old myth might sound magical but it can keep you stuck waiting for permission you dont need go ahead and buy yourself that deck that catches your eye start your tarot journey today not when someone else decides youre ready your intuition is already there inside you and waiting to grow your tarot journey starts when you say it does and not when someone else hands you a deck so what are you waiting for go find your perfect deck today

support for their six children pitts camp insists that the actor has paid out 93 million since the couples 2016 split jolie has as a hollywood source close to the joliepitts told the post tried to paint her ex as a deadbeat dad and created a rift between the actor and his kids in court documents pitts lawyers called out jolie and her lawyers for filing papers that are calculated to increase the conflict and are a thinly veiled effort to manipulate media coverage just this month she was playing mind games around august 1 pitt asked jolie through lawyers to end the marriage as soon as possible even before the highprofile couple has worked out a custody schedule and financial agreement through her team jolie asked her ex to wait a week to consider his request then filed her own motion requesting the exact same thing angelina filed with the judge to make it look like she wanted the early divorce before brad did said los angeles divorce attorney peter walzer who has cases up against one of jolies lawyers laura wasser some say its an act of revenge by jolie who was of course the first to make the public strike in the split she doesnt want brad to move on said the family source shes furious that hes not chasing after her and that fury is now ruining her image jolies latest round of fire also comes this month when she hired two new attorneys hollywood bigwig joseph mannis who

of jolies and with whom she set up a sexualviolenceprevention initiative for women in bangladesh they played a big role in all of this telling angelina youre the greatest the hollywood source said of

then people connected to her floated information to the media that pitt had punched one of their kids on a flight in a drunken high rage said the family source according to tmz jolie told a social

to be arrested she really started a whispering campaign against brad that was demonstrably false jolie was further left fuming according to the hollywood source when her ex was given a standing ovation by the audience at the january 2017 golden globes after months out of the spotlight angelina went crazy thats why she insisted on releasing a joint statement two days later added the hollywood source she was trying to attach herself to him so people wouldnt view her unfavorably in the joint statement released on january 10 2017 jolie and pitt said they were hiring a private judge and would handle their divorce in a private forum while working to reunify their family but then the family source said angelina believed the only way to win was to go in for the kill jolies team publicly leaked court documents alongside a statement about a lack of child support to nbc news earlier this month she went on the attack the family source said essentially angelinas calling brad a deadbeat dad when he pays for the kids security hotels and private jets all he wants is to see his kids insiders also told the post that jolie has made that difficult in the past two years angelina has driven a wedge between pitt and the kids from controlling their phone calls to telling the kids they dont need to see him and picking times he can see them when she knows hes working said a source with intimate knowledge of the divorce in june judge john ouderkirk who also presided over the couples august 2015 civil wedding ceremony told jolie that if the children remain closed down to their father she faced losing custody of them the actress was ordered to give pitt the numbers for all the kids phones as well as to refrain from monitoring any conversations between him and the children currently pitt gets visitation with maddox 17 pax 14 zahara 13 shiloh 12 and twins vivienne and knox 10 for four hours every other day and 12 hours over the weekend there is one exception the court is allowing maddox to decide how much time he spends with his father on wednesday news leaked that jolie and pitt had come to terms on an interim custody agreement however a source close to pitt said that the couple have the same interim agreement that has been in place for a while with a more permanent custody deal still to be decided there was no new agreement this was totally made up the source said the biggest joke is that she continues to be awful toward him angie has these wild mood swings the source added she had launched this aggressive tone which backfired saying shes poor when shes making 25 million a movie and saying brads not paid child support this week she came back all mellow and super nice its a direct reaction to the fact that people did not react well to her previous blow jolies representatives did not respond to requests for comment as for financial support pitts lawyers have reiterated that he loaned jolie 8 million so she could buy a 19 million home the estate of legendary filmmaker cecil b demille and has paid out more than 13 million in child support for pitt said the hollywood source its really the alienation from his kids thats the worst walzer said jolie needs to be careful about her behavior ahead of a custody hearing which will be followed by family visits with a courtappointed psychologist when somebody is in the throes of this kind of custody proceeding theyre not always rational he explained if you look uncooperative it could be worse for you if you look like youre the alienating parent then youre putting yourself at risk do you really want to do that and then theres jolies public reputation this is certainly not the first time jolie has puppeteered her image and the lives of those around her she became truly famous after years of undertheradar movie roles when she stole the show in the 1999 movie girl interrupted at that point jolie was hollywoods ultimate bad girl she dressed in witchy black was using drugs as she would admit to years later including going to disneyland while on acid and shocked the world when she shared an uncomfortably intimate kiss with her brother james at the 2000 oscars where she won best supporting actress that year she married billy bob thornton who allegedly dumped fiance laura dern to be with her and took her reputation into overdrive when the two hit the red carpet wearing vials of each others blood but by 2003 the couple had split and she was ready to reinvent she became a mom on her own to a son maddox adopted from cambodia hooking up with pitt in 2004 on the set of mr and mrs smith she was seen as the vixen who stole the man of americas sweetheart jennifer aniston there was nowhere to go but up so the transformation to st angie kicked into high gear as she adopted more children and pursued an interest in human rights angelina did one of the greatest jobs ever in developing a new persona said the hollywood source one step at a time jolie showed her softer side the couple was seen taking their multiracial brood of six around the world jolie became a special envoy to the united nations and she publicly and poignantly spoke of her mothers death from ovarian cancer and her own decision to have a double mastectomy and surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes after discovering she tested positive for the brca1 gene angie was controlling her own narrative said the hollywood source she was a role model there was a relatability about her and her health issues she did a great job to combine all of these things but it seems jolie may have finally lost control ultimately she almost got too comfortable acting as a role model added the hollywood source she wasnt able to adapt to some of the realities of her marriage and her life she just assumed that people would follow whatever she said including her husband and so when they had marital issues she believed she could just bully him into whatever she wanted after her marriage to pitt came apart jolie employed a master stroke of public relations breaking her silence on the split while in cambodia promoting a movie she had directed first they killed my father looking upset she told the bbc in february this year it had been a very difficult time we are a family and we will always be a family and we will get through this time and hopefully be a stronger family for it i am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer however the jolie insider said the actress was beset by old demons you can try to change as much as you want but youre always going to go back to who you truly are she cant help herself according to page six jolie is also fuming that she has been usurped as the worlds most glamorous humanitarian by amal clooney the stylish humanrights lawyer who is married to george clooney angelina hates all the attention that amal is getting said a jolie insider the brunette reportedly feels amal has pulled a single white female and stolen her identity the insider added angie cant understand why she herself has become so unpopular in hollywood for his part pitt has given only one interview since the split to gq in may 2017 in which he detailed how he had given up the alcohol and marijuana that he had used as a crutch he spoke of his fears for his children and said it is a drag to have certain things drug out in public and misconstrued i worry about it more for my kids being subjected to it and their friends getting ideas from it this said the hollywood source is why he just wants to finalize things as quietly and peacefully as possible hes not having the best time but hes hanging in there hes hopeful this will all be resolved but hollywoods former golden couple is now reduced to barely speaking to each other added the hollywood source they talk some but not very much once you go down this road and st gets flung about then its very difficult

season of the bachelor or after the final rose as host chris harrison warns each and every season the bachelor finale is always dramatic but this weeks controversial closer had an unprecedented ending which has since stirred an uproar on monday nights finale the bachelor arie luyendyk jr proposed to becca kufrin and the couple was engaged however over the next two months after the season had wrapped luyendyk had a change of heart and realized he made the wrong choice and was actually in love with runnerup lauren burnham so he broke up with kufrin and the entire thing was caught on film abcs cameras followed luyendyk as he broke off his engagement to kufrin and the network aired the scene completely unedited showing exactly what happened between the pair during the difficult conversation the following night on after the final rose kufrin was named abcs next leading lady who will star in the bachelorette and her journey to find love again began last night on after the final rose meanwhile luyendyk sat down with burnham on after the final rose as the glowing couple told america about their rekindled relationship over the past two months and then luyendyk proposed to burnham the two are now engaged and have embarked on a mini media tour sitting down with jimmy kimmel and making appearances today on abcs good morning america and live with kelly and ryan the dramatic twopart finale has garnered overwhelming support for kufrin but has caused a social media outcry in response to luyendyks behavior here abcs executive in charge of the bachelor franchise robert mills senior vp of alternative series specials and latenight programming talks to variety about filming the breakup and choosing to air the footage completely unedited plus what he thinks about kufrin as the next bachelorette looking back on the entire season what do you think overall i liked this season i think its pretty clear we made a conscious decision to do a more straightforward season of the bachelor and i liked that because at the end of the day we really believe in this concept and really want it to be about finding love and making connections im really proud of it creatively im not blind that the ratings are down so thats a bit of a disappointment and i wish that the audience had liked this season a little better weve seen some negativity both toward arie and the some of the people in this season and the show in general so every season when the show ends me and the producers take a look at what worked and what didnt and we will work to make a phenomenal season of the bachelorette what went into the decision to film arie and becca after the proposal you had never done that before it lends credence to the fact that the bachelor is not just over the top because one of the problems with the show is that youre dating people in a way that you never would in real life and then you have to start a life with this person and so in the finale you actually see what happens in the real world its incredibly relatable and its a place weve all been the stuff you see here is stuff that weve all done and weve all been through theres heartbreak and there is hope but it is riveting and its why we watch the bachelor because when good or bad things happen we all want to relate that these things happen to other people when the show really does that its when its at its best what was your reaction when arie started having second thoughts and wanted to break up with becca to get back together with lauren you go to the place where you say this will be great riveting tv but youve got to realize that these are real people not just becca but arie and lauren and this could happen to anyone so i think that makes it really difficult part of the importance of doing this on camera is its sort of a contract with the audience that youre going to see the whole relationship from beginning to end on tv and youre taking that journey with them and its important to understand the whole thing because now there will be no doubt in anyones mind what the reason is that arie and becca broke up people can feel how they want to after seeing it as opposed to just hearing about it you have never shown footage of a couple after the proposal and in this case you filmed for an additional two months in future seasons will you be continuing to film couples after the proposal the things weve learned with the bachelor is that it has to constantly evolve like you see with the fantasy suite now you see the morning after and thats really important because its a totally different phase of the relationship and those conversations inform how all of the decisions are going to be made so this change is the same thing and i think youll start to see more of this now as we keep evolving the show was it just a coincidence that the first time you decided to continue to film after the proposal that this bombshell breakup happened it wasnt purposeful a lot of the stuff was shot on iphones and its just stuff that we had of them being together and being kind of goofy together it was interesting watching it and getting to see how these people are in real life so i am glad it gave us a reason to use that iphone footage and i think well look at how we can implement that more in seasons going forward but it wasnt like oh my god thank god we had this footage it just worked itself in organically into the fabric of the finale can you clear up the timeline of the proposal and the breakup and lauren starting to date arie the proposal happened right before thanksgiving and then the breakup happened in january so it was almost two months in between and thats when arie asked lauren for a second chance just so they can date and that was two months ago and things are going incredibly well how long after the breakup did abc ask becca to be the bachelorette you have to be respectful you cant say you just had your heart broken do you want to meet 25 new guys it was a very slow process fortunately we had time because this was midjanuary and the finale doesnt air until midmarch i know two months doesnt seem like a lot and the feelings are still raw but she still just wanted to keep trying i think when youve had great tragedy in your life like shes had there is a resilience that starts to come in and you realize that for better or worse life goes on and youre better off taking a chance so we moved slowly asking her to be the bachelorette but when she came around to it it got really exciting it started very slowly and then it got very serious in the middle of february she actually hadnt signed until basically a couple of days ago so it was definitely a lot of thinking shes also very close with her family and i dont know if her family wanted her to jump right back into a show that caused her so much heartbreak but they are supportive and thats fantastic theres been a lot of discussion surrounding the lack of diversity with leads on the bachelor franchise and just last year rachel lindsay was the firstever african american lead on the bachelorette what went into the decision naming becca next seasons lead im super proud of this cast from aries season we look at everything and diversity is not only ethnicity but also its the types of women that we had and i was really happy that we had a lot of types of different women we had a lot of professional women and strong women who are their own women with becca it was really a nobrainer decision i think everybody after they see how this plays out theyre going to want to see her get her happy ending this is a girl whos been through so much she lost her dad to brain cancer her mother had a battle with breast cancer shes really strong and resilient and you really root for her after the finale earlier in the season beccas boyfriend from her past showed up and a lot of people on twitter criticized that scene for seeming staged solely to create drama he obviously didnt just pop up in peru so how did he show up im really glad you asked that we sit down at the end of every season and we look at things and we say this is good this worked people didnt like this or people responded to this for me and the producers something that really didnt sit right was when demarios jackson girlfriend came back in rachels lindsay season it just felt completely fake and it felt like this woman had a speech prepared and was ready to go so when you see all of that if it plays as false then it pulls on a sweater thread and the whole thing can fall apart because it all seems false and its not so in this case this guy reached out to production and said he heard becca was on the show and he was really upset and wanted to see her and as a producer you think thats a great storyline if its authentic but at the very least we had to make sure that this guy was willing to put up the money to get to peru and see if this guy is genuine and didnt want to just get on tv and he did so once we realized that this guy really has feelings for becca and he wants to go we did it this was a guy that becca had spoken about many times on the show as the one big relationship that she had and seven years thats a long time so thats how it all came to be why did you originally cast arie as this seasons lead is it because he is a bit older and perhaps ready for a real relationship its funny because arie is the same age as nick viall but i think the reason why arie comes off as older is because he has a more mature lifestyle nick viall almost feels like an earlytomid 20something who is still figuring himself out and moved to la arie lives in scottsdale ariz where hes showing houses and hes even slowed down with the racing hes a grownup i think thats the difference and thats part of what went into the decisionmaking i thought nicks season was great and i absolutely love nick but you watched that finale last year and he got engaged to vanessa grimaldi and it should have been this fullcircle moment for him because he got so close with andi dorfmann and then he got so close with kaitlyn bristowe and then he finally found this person and it just felt like this thing is going to last for five minutes and thats what ended up happening and everyone has to do their own thing so im not decrying anything that he did but it just felt like we really wanted to find someone who was going to leave the spotlight after this was over and thats arie he was never one of those people that was really on social media and stayed in the bachelor circle he was just living his life it seems like the intention in casting arie was to make this season the most authentic it could possibly be when it comes to looking for love so why do you think ratings were down this season i dont know but i will tell you that i was surprised when the ratings were up when nick viall was the bachelor so sometimes you just dont know nick was a rollofthedice because hed been on bachelor in paradise which is not usually the breeding ground for the lead so sometimes you cant put your finger on these things when sean lowe was the bachelor it really came down to him and arie and it was down to the wire because people really wanted to see arie be the bachelor because he was so heartbroken by emily maynard so when we were making the bachelor this year it was surprising how many people said they didnt know who he was i know five years is not yesterday but its also not so long ago he was somebody who always remained in the conversation with fans maybe not as many as i thought but i thought there was a lot of appeal for arie and it was fascinating to see that we had to reeducate people on arie on i think arie also had to reeducate himself what its like to be on this type of show i think he has a lot of personality and its really on us for not showing more of that you saw on the women tell all that he is really very funny and i think if we had maybe shown more of that maybe that would have helped also we premiered on new years day and then the next day was the college football championship game and then you had the olympics so we had a lot of strikes against us but it still felt like people cared i heard a lot of chatter about the season online so you believe the numbers being down are due to competing programming and perhaps the lack of awareness for arie not any sort of bachelor fatigue among audiences i dont think theres bachelor fatigue the people that are watching certainly all seem to like it and live for it they might not like certain elements but i havent seen anyone say im done watching the bachelor but it is an interesting time right now in the world and there might be people who say i just dont feel like i can get an escape right now because the world is in a weird place on the flip side of that do you think the political climate and intense news cycle serve as a benefit to the show because it can be an escape for viewers i think thats right even when things are horrible on the show as weve seen in this finale there still is a measure of hope at the end of the day we are trying to make a version of a fairytale here and there is something about love that is hopeful even when it is love thats lost theres always going to be hope at the end of the day there is something hopeful and escapist about this show weve all made a fool of ourselves or gotten dumped so i think theres so much relatability to show what do you expect beccas season of the bachelorette to be like this could be one of the stranger seasons of the bachelorette because she might not truly be over arie and it may not work i certainly hope it does and we will do everything we possibly can to make sure it does but you just dont know it certainly is a chance worth taking popular

stimulus health care legislation new rules for wall street but you have a big battle coming when it comes to the bush tax cuts if they remain in place as republicans want it will cost three trillion dollars every ten years the administration has said it wants to keep the ones for people who make under 200000 a year individuals and 250000 for couples that will cost 25 trillion over 10 years ben bernanke the chairman of the federal reserve said that with the economic outlook unusually uncertain extending the bush tax cuts would have a stimulative effect on the economy is he right geithner i dont think it should be a battle jake you know what the presidents proposing to do is to leave in place to extend tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working americans and to leave in place tax cuts that are very important to incent businesses to hire new pe new employees and to invest in expanding output we think thats a the its a very strong package we think its the right package we think its fair we think its responsible now we also think its responsible to let the tax cuts expire that just go to 2 percent to 3 percent of americans the highest earning americans we think thats the responsible thing to do because we need to make sure we can show the world that theyre willing as a country now to start to make some progress bringing down our long our longterm deficits tapper dont you think it will slow economic growth geithner no just letting those tax cuts that only go to 2 percent to 3 percent of americans the highest earning americans in the country expire i do not believe it will have a negative effect on growth tapper this package that youre talking about pushing in congress to to save the bush tax cuts for people under 200000 individuals and 250 for couples geithner and in fact we go beyond that because you know were proposing to extend the make or pay tax cut which also goes to 95 percent of working americans and a set of very important business tax cuts targeted for small businesses themselves expensing zero capital gains rate for investment in small businesses these things we think are very helpful very powerful tapper and when are you talking about pushing that into congress geithner congress is on the verge of what we hope will be enactment of a very strong package of tax measures for small businesses and ways to help them get credit so they can expand tapper so before the election geithner oh absolutely tapper a number of senate democrats moderate senate democrats have said that they oppose repealing or allowing to expire the bush tax cuts on the wealthiest americans that they think that would be harmful to growth are you guys going to have the votes to get through the package you want which is focused more on middle and lower income america geithner oh absolutely i believe we will tapper some in the administration and internal discussions are talking about maybe just keeping all the bush tax cuts for a year or two those arent thats not going to happen geithner i dont believe it should and i dont believe it will again because what the presidents proposed is to make sure were leaving them in place for the people that need the most and can make the most difference in helping make sure this economy comes back that we heal the damage caused by this crisis tapper job creation has not gone as well as you hoped what more can you do i know theres this small business lending initiative what more can you do given the lack of appetite on capitol hill for any spending programs any more stimulus geithner well you know the presidents proposed a very strong package of help for small businesses which you just referred to hed support giving more support to states so they can keep teachers in the classroom tapper fifty billion dollars in emergency spending but the congress has not acted on that geithner they havent yet but we can inaudible case for doing it theyre going to were going to keep at that but right now the best thing the government can do in addition to those things is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again now weve seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector thats pretty good tapper by the private sector geithner pretty good this early in a recession tapper although you count in the public sector with the layoffs and the census jobs geithner but only because of census but you know what matters is is the private sector starting to hire people add back hours and thats whats critical and youre seeing that happen now now we want it we want to see it happen at a faster pace but i think most people understand that you know this was a deep crisis the scars ran very deep devastating damage its going to take time to repair that damage take time to grow out of this but were making progress tapper in 2009 when president obama talked about unemployment insurance extensions he talked about how it was paid for this time it was not paid for the 34 billion in unemployment insurance extensions became added to the national debt republicans on capitol hill argued that they wanted to pay for it and they supported it but they just wanted it offset by spending cuts given the fact that were going to be were going to have unemployment for the foreseeable future high unemployment isnt it the fiscally responsible thing to do to not treat this as emergency spending but treat this as something we know is coming down the pike so were not just laying this burden on our future generations geithner i dont think so in a crisis that was this bad and a recession that was that deep with this amount of lasting damage scars from recovery its appropriate to treat these things as emergencies

bahamian island of great exuma2 the event was promoted on instagram by social media influencers actors reality tv stars and models including kendall jenner bella hadid hailey baldwin and emily ratajkowski many of whom did not initially disclose they had been paid to do so1 during the fyre festivals inaugural weekend the event experienced problems related to security food accommodation medical services and artist relations resulting in the festival being indefinitely postponed and eventually cancelled instead of the gourmet meals and luxury villas for which festival attendees had paid hundreds or even thousands of dollars they received packaged sandwiches and were lodged in poorly furnished tents3 in march 2018 mcfarland pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud to defraud investors and ticket holders and a second count to defraud a ticket vendor while out on bail4 in october 2018 mcfarland was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to forfeit us26 million4 at least eight lawsuits were initiated against the organizers for defrauding ticket buyers with several seeking class action status and one seeking more than 100 million in damages and a judgment for us2 million5 two documentaries about the events of the festival were released in 2019 hulus fyre fraud6 and netflixs fyre the greatest party that never happened78 in february 2025 it was reported that mcfarland was selling tickets for fyre 2 to run from may 30 to june 2 20259 on april 4 2025 news organizations reported that two cities in mexico have both denied the festival is taking place and have no knowledge of the event this includes the most recently announced location playa del carmen10 the festival was postponed on april 16 2025 to be rescheduled at a later date11 planning and organization edit billy mcfarland and ja rule at the 2016 web summit an aircraft used to transport attendees to the festival featuring fyre festival branding the festival was organized by billy mcfarland and ja rule to promote the fyre music booking app31 ja rule had come to know mcfarland through regular visits to events mcfarland hosted for his previous venture magnises during a flight to the bahamas mcfarland and ja rules private plane touched down on a lightly populated island which they later discovered was normans cay the former private island of carlos lehder rivas a kingpin of the medelln cartel and a close associate of its leader pablo escobar12 mcfarland then leased the island from the current owners with the owners giving the strict condition that mcfarland make no reference to escobar in any marketing materials13 promotional footage with hired supermodels was shot on normans cay and planning for the festival went ahead on december 12 2016 kendall jenner emily ratajkowski and other influencers paid by fyre simultaneously posted to their instagram feeds a video with a thumbnail consisting of an orange square and a logo made of stylized flames the video showed bella hadid and other models represented by her agency running around a tropical beach text with the video promised an immersive music festival two transformative weekends on the boundaries of the impossible this was the beginning of the fyre festivals promotional campaign during which mcfarland himself claimed that the island had been owned by pablo escobar a falsehood14 the owners cancelled their arrangement with mcfarland soon after15 after being kicked off of normans cay the organizers had only four months to find a new venue before the fyre festivals april 28 start date after several small islands turned them down and with only two months to go before the festival they were granted a permit by the bahamian government to use a site set aside for development at rokers point on great exuma14 material released on social media continued to promote the falsehood that the festival was being hosted on pablo escobars private island with maps of the site altered to make it appear as if rokers point was an island unto itself13 in reality great exuma was neither a private nor remote island and the rokers point site was a remote parking lot part of an abandoned resort development just north of sandals emerald bay resort and a nearby marina where locals boats were storedcitation needed mcfarland never announced the change he just simply began referring to the location as fyre cay with no infrastructure and no villas the team had just under two months to turn rokers point into fyre cay an investor fashion executive carola jain reportedly arranged for fyre to receive a 4 million loan most of which was used to rent luxurious offices in manhattans tribeca neighborhood with no experience staging an event of the proposed festivals scale mcfarland began approaching companies that did and was reportedly taken aback when informed the event would cost at least 50 million to stage in the time available as he had promised furthermore the more experienced consultants told them that in addition to the cost an event of this magnitude would have needed an extra year to plan mcfarland and his associates at fyre believed it would cost far less and continued with their plans under that assumption the organizers tried to do things themselves where possible mcfarland supposedly learned how to rent the stage by doing a google search14 in the days leading up to the festival they cut expenses extensively having learned that the luxury villas alone were going to cost 10 million and targeted funds from deposits to pay for the bands food infrastructure and staff scheduled for two weekends in april and may 2017 the event sold day tickets at prices from 500 to 1500 and vip packages including airfare and luxury tent accommodation for 12000 customers were promised accommodation in modern ecofriendly geodesic domes16 and meals from celebrity chefs17 the final advertised lineup was for 33 artists including pusha t tyga desiigner blink182 major lazer disclosure migos rae sremmurd kaytranada lil yachty matoma klingande skepta claptone le youth tensnake blondish and lee burridge18 in the days leading up to the festival all of these acts pulled out as a further complication the first festival weekend coincided with the exuma regatta a bahamian sailing race series that used most of the islands hotels vacation rentals and other resources while the festivals promotional material kept claiming that the festival would be held on a remote private island that once belonged to drug trafficker pablo escobar workers were busy preparing rokers point for the festival scattering sand over its rocks and improving a road to a nearby beach where they built some cabanas and installed swing seats14 on the mainland 5000 tickets had been sold and an air service was hired to fly festivalgoers from miami a medical services company and caterer were also hired but the caterer withdrew a few weeks before the festival14 with only two weeks to go a new catering service was hired with a 1 million total budget drastically reduced from the 6 million originally allocated to provide what was promised as uniquely authentic island cuisine local seafood bahamianstyle sushi and even a pig roast133 in march 2017 fyre hired a veteran event producer yaron lavi who saw that it was impossible to hold the sort of event mcfarland and ja rule envisioned at the site given the lack of time until the event he assumed they would postpone it to november as they had been discussing however when fyre told him they would stage the event in the spring anyway lavi told them to abandon plans for temporary villas and instead erect tents the only accommodation that could be delivered in the time remaining lavi advised fyre to make this clear to those who had already bought tickets as otherwise it would be damaging to their brand he says the company assured him that an email was being prepared but when interviewed afterward he was still not sure if it was ever sent14 comcast ventures considered investing 25 million in the fyre app which mcfarland apparently hoped would allow him to finance the festival but declined days beforehand19 reportedly mcfarland had valued fyre media at 90 million but was unable to provide sufficient proof of that when comcast requested it14 writing for new york magazine one of the event organizers later noted that since at least midmarch there had been significant problems with the planning and at one point it was suggested they reschedule the 2017 festival until 201820 this idea was dropped at the last minute and it was decided to go on with the event as planned lets just do it and be legends man one of the organizers is reported to have said20 after the comcast deal fell through mcfarland obtained 3 million in temporary financing for fyre through investor ezra birnbaum with a requirement that the company repay at least 500000 of the loan within 16 days14 fyre informed ticket holders that the event would be cashless and cardless with purchases at the festival to be paid for with an rfid fyreband linked to their credit card2122 despite warnings that such digital bracelets would be useless because of the poor wifi connection at the site13 in order to raise quick cash for the event and with under two weeks to go before the inaugural event attendees were encouraged to load their fyrebands with thousands of dollars in advance according to one lawsuit23 mcfarland who signed the email suggested that attendees deposit 300500 for every day they planned to attend about 2 million from festival goers was taken for these bracelets 40 of which according to a lawsuit later filed by birnbaum was used by mcfarland to pay off the shortterm loan1424 festival events and attendee experiences edit early in the morning on april 27 heavy rain fell on great exuma soaking the open tents and mattresses that had been piled out in the open for the guests arriving later that day the first flights from miami international airport to exuma international airport operated by swift air and xtra airways landed at 620 am13 that afternoon blink182 announced that it was withdrawing from the festival stating in a twitter post were not confident that we would have what we need to give you the quality of performances we always give our fans13 initial arrivals were taken to an impromptu beach party at a beachside restaurant where they were plied with alcohol and kept waiting for around six hours while frantic preparations at the festival site continued13 mcfarland had hired hundreds of local workers to help build the site meanwhile organizers had to renegotiate the guarantees they offered to the people who would be playing at the festival as costs spiraled out of control later arrivals were taken directly to the grounds by school bus where the true state of the festivals site became apparent their accommodations were little more than scattered disaster relief tents with dirt floors some with mattresses that were soaking wet as a result of the morning rain instead of the gourmet food promised there was nothing more than inadequate and poor quality food such as cheese sandwiches served in foam containers2526 festivalgoers were dropped off at the production bungalow where mcfarland and his team were based and instructed to register having waited hours however attendees instead rushed to claim their tents13 even though there were only about 500 attendees at this point there were still not enough tents and beds attendees were unable to leave the festival for the nearby sandals resort as it was peak season with almost every hotel on great exuma already fully booked for the annual exuma regatta around nightfall a group of local musicians took to the stage and played for a few hours this was the only performance to actually occur in the early morning it was announced that the festival would be postponed and the attendees would be returned to miami as soon as possible reports from the festival mentioned various other problems such as the mishandling or theft of guests baggage no lighting an unfinished gravel lot a lack of medical personnel and event staff no cell phone or internet service insufficient portable toilets no running water and heavyhanded security27 as the festival had been promoted as a cashless event many attendees lacked money for taxi fare or other expenses many attendees were reportedly stranded as flights to and from the island were cancelled after the bahamian government issued an order that barred any planes from landing at the airport328 the first flight back to miami boarded at 130 am on april 28 but was delayed for hours due to issues with the flights manifest it was cancelled after sunrise leaving passengers locked in the exuma airport terminal with no access to food water or air conditioning29 a passenger wrote on social media that at least one person there passed out from the heat29 the flight left exuma later that morning and more charter flights to miami departed from exuma throughout the day one attendee who was stuck in miami reported that the pilot of their airplane had told them to get off so they could turn the plane around for immediate departure as the plane was now serving as a rescue aircraft to get attendees off great exuma islandcitation needed involved parties edit organizers edit in

could unlock their cities and take their lives to the next level including private membersonly concerts tastings with notable chefs and exclusive art previews at top galleries the washington post reported that some of those benefits never materialized or were far from what was advertised31 they send the same email for every problem but its like fillintheblanks for what the problem is a member

politifact5659,1,remarks by the president on oil and gas subsidies the white house office of the press secretary remarks by the president on oil and gas subsidies rose garden 1100 am edt the president thank you very much applause everybody please have a seat sorry were running just a little bit behind but i figured its a great day to enjoy the rose garden today members of congress have a simple choice to make they can stand with the big oil companies or they can stand with the american people right now the biggest oil companies are raking in record profits profits that go up every time folks pull up into a gas station but on top of these record profits oil companies are also getting billions a year billions a year in taxpayer subsidies a subsidy that theyve enjoyed year after year for the last century think about that its like hitting the american people twice youre already paying a premium at the pump right now and on top of that congress up until this point has thought it was a good idea to send billions of dollars more in tax dollars to the oil industry its not as if these companies cant stand on their own last year the three biggest us oil companies took home more than 80 billion in profits exxon pocketed nearly 47 million every hour and when the price of oil goes up prices at the pump go up and so do these companies profits in fact one analysis shows that every time gas goes up by a penny these companies usually pocket another 200 million in quarterly profits meanwhile these companies pay a lower tax rate than most other companies on their investments partly because were giving them billions in tax giveaways every year now i want to make clear we all know that drilling for oil has to be a key part of our overall energy strategy we want us oil companies to be doing well we want them to succeed thats why under my administration weve opened up millions of acres of federal lands and waters to oil and gas production weve quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high weve added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the earth and then some and just yesterday we announced the next step for potential new oil and gas exploration in the atlantic so the fact is were producing more oil right now than we have in eight years and were importing less of it as well for two years in a row america has bought less oil from other countries than we produce here at home for the first time in over a decade so american oil is booming the oil industry is doing just fine with record profits and rising production im not worried about the big oil companies with high oil prices around the world theyve got more than enough incentive to produce even more oil thats why i think its time they got by without more help from taxpayers who are already having a tough enough time paying the bills and filling up their gas tank and i think its curious that some folks in congress who are the first to belittle investments in new sources of energy are the ones that are fighting the hardest to maintain these giveaways for the oil companies instead of taxpayer giveaways to an industry thats never been more profitable we should be using that money to doubledown on investments in clean energy technologies that have never been more promising investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels investments in fuelefficient cars and trucks and energyefficient homes and buildings thats the future thats the only way were going to break this cycle of high gas prices that happen year after year after year as the economy is growing the only time you start seeing lower gas prices is when the economy is doing badly thats not the kind of pattern that we want to be in we want the economy doing well and people to be able to afford their energy costs and keep in mind we cant just drill our way out of this problem as i said oil production here in the united states is doing very well and its been doing well even as gas prices are going up well the reason is because we use more than 20 percent of the worlds oil but we only have 2 percent of the worlds known oil reserves and that means we could drill every drop of american oil tomorrow but wed still have to buy oil from other countries to make up the difference wed still have to depend on other countries to meet our energy needs and because its a world market the fact that were doing more here in the united states doesnt necessarily help us because even us oil companies theyre selling that oil on a worldwide market theyre not keeping it just for us and that means that if theres rising demand around the world then the prices are going to up thats not the future that i want for america i dont want folks like these back here and the folks in front of me to have to pay more at the pump every time that theres some unrest in the middle east and oil speculators get nervous about whether theres going to be enough supply i dont want our kids to be held hostage to events on the other side of the world i want us to control our own destiny i want us to forge our own future and thats why as long as im president america is going to pursue an alloftheabove energy strategy which means we will continue developing our oil and gas resources in a robust and responsible way but it also means that were going to keep developing more advanced homegrown biofuels the kinds that are already powering truck fleets across america were going to keep investing in clean energy like the wind power and solar power thats already lighting thousands of homes and creating thousands of jobs were going to keep manufacturing more cars and trucks to get more miles to the gallon so that you can fill up once every two weeks instead of every week were going to keep building more homes and businesses that waste less energy so that youre in charge of your own energy bills were going to do all of this by harnessing our most inexhaustible resource american ingenuity and american imagination thats what we need to keep going thats whats at stake right now thats the choice that we face and thats the choice thats facing congress today they can either vote to spend billions of dollars more in oil subsidies that keep us trapped in the past or they can vote to end these taxpayer subsidies that arent needed to boost oil production so that we can invest in the future its that simple and as long as im president im betting on the future and as the people ive talked to around the country including the people who are behind me here today they put their faith in the future as well thats what we do as americans thats who we are we innovate we discover we seek new solutions to some of our biggest challenges and ultimately because we stick with it we succeed and i believe that were going to do that again today the american people are going to be watching congress to see if they have that same faith thank you very much everybody applause end 1108 am edt

tried multiple times to initiate sexual activity with the man including forcing him to massage his groin during the massage session spacey then allegedly repeatedly tried to prevent the man from leaving in 2019 while both the lawsuit and the criminal investigations were still pending the accuser died of cancer the district attorney subsequently declined to pursue the charges in 2021 the hollywood reporter reported that two different massage businesses the app soothe and the chain burke williams had both banned spacey from booking appointments because of a past history of allegedly assaulting their staff members variety reported that in august 2018 the los angeles district attorneys office received a new investigation referral from the sheriffs office into an allegation against spacey no information was available about the date details or alleged victim of the incident its unclear whether this investigation is connected to at least two other investigations referred to the da involving spacey as variety noted the da has yet to pursue any of the charges spaceys supporters say he has apologized and repented he hasnt spacey has continually denied nearly all of the allegations against him while creating the impression that some of the alleged encounters are simply fumbling or socially awkward misunderstandings he came out as gay in response to rapps initial allegations which many people saw as an attempt at deflection and subsequently remained defiant as the litany of accusations piled up then there was the bizarre 2018 video in which he roleplayed his former house of cards character frank underwood in language that recalls several of the more disturbing allegations of nonconsensual physical assault made against spacey the actor seems to tell the audience that hes making a comeback regardless of what they say they want were not done no matter what anyone says and besides i know what you want you want me back spacey released more distasteful videos each subsequent year through 2021 then returned in 2023 alongside tucker carlson in the latest video he claimed that the allegations against him had been proven false spacey is far from the only alleged sexual predator in hollywood or the only one whos led a successful career despite his behavior apparently being an open secret and while some of the most powerful men in the industry including weinstein and former cbs head les moonves have seen their careers topple others remain largely unscathed by allegations against them spaceys repeated diminishment of the high number of allegations against him suggest that he has yet to fully accept either the reality of his own actions or any responsibility for the harm he has allegedly caused and despite the overwhelming number of people whove spoken out against him he seems to feel entitled to a comeback its highly unlikely hell get one but his confidence is a telling statement about an entertainment industry that for so long has allowed powerful men to operate with impunity one that allowed him to allegedly prey on targets for decades with no repercussions and that could still harbor many predators in its midst vox has reached out to spaceys representatives for comment but has received no response update june 12 2024 950 am this story was originally published in 2017 and has been updated multiple times most recently to include spaceys appearance on piers morgan uncensored

politifact6871,1,transcript of wednesdays presidential debate denver cnn the following is a transcript of wednesday nights presidential debate in denver 210140 jim lehrer good evening from the magness arena at the university of denver in denver colorado im jim lehrer of the pbs newshour and i welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential debates between president barack obama the democratic nominee and former massachusetts governor mitt romney the republican nominee this debate and the next three two presidential one vice presidential are sponsored by the commission on presidential debates tonights 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission there will be six roughly 15minute segments with twominute answers for the first question then open discussion for the remainder of each segment thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the internet and other means but i made the final selections and for the record they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates the segments as i announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care the role of government and governing with an emphasis throughout on differences specifics and choices both candidates will also have twominute closing statements the audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent no cheers applause boos hisses among other noisy distracting things so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say there is a noise exception right now though as we welcome president obama and governor romney applause gentlemen welcome to you both lets start the economy segment one and lets begin with jobs what are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs you have two minutes each of you have two minutes to start a coin toss has determined mr president you go first 210424 president barack obama well thank you very much jim for this opportunity i want to thank governor romney and the university of denver for your hospitality there are a lot of points i want to make tonight but the most important one is that 20 years ago i became the luckiest man on earth because michelle obama agreed to marry me and so i just want to wish sweetie you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people laughter you know four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the great depression millions of jobs were lost the auto industry was on the brink of collapse the financial system had frozen up and because of the resilience and the determination of the american people weve begun to fight our way back over the last 30 months weve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created the auto industry has come roaring back and housing has begun to rise but we all know that weve still got a lot of work to do and so the question here tonight is not where weve been but where were going governor romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes skewed towards the wealthy and roll back regulations that well be better off ive got a different view i think weve got to invest in education and training i think its important for us to develop new sources of energy here in america that we change our tax code to make sure that were helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the united states that we take some of the money that were saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild america and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments now it ultimately is going to be up to the voters to you which path we should take are we going to double on topdown economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says america does best when the middle class does best and im looking forward to having that debate 21 0631 lehrer governor romney two minutes 210632 former gov mitt romney thank you jim its an honor to be here with you and i appreciate the chance to be with the president im pleased to be at the university of denver appreciate their welcome and also the presidential commission on these debates and congratulations to you mr president on your anniversary im sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine here here with me so i laughter congratulations this is obviously a very tender topic ive had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country i was in dayton ohio and a woman grabbed my arm and she said ive been out of work since may can you help me ann yesterday was at a rally in denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said ann my husband has had four jobs in three years parttime jobs hes lost his most recent job and weve now just lost our home can you help us and the answer is yes we can help but its going to take a different path not the one weve been on not the one the president describes as a topdown cut taxes for the rich thats not what im going to do my plan has five basic parts one get us energy independent north american energy independent that creates about 4 million jobs number two open up more trade particularly in latin america crack down on china if and when they cheat number three make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world were far away from that now number four get to us a balanced budget number five champion small business its small business that creates the jobs in america and over the last four years small business people have decided that america may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30year low now im concerned that the path that were on has just been unsuccessful the president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years that a bigger government spending more taxing more regulating more if you will trickledown government would work thats not the right answer for america ill restore the vitality that gets america working again thank you 210840 lehrer mr president please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickledown his trickdown approach as he said yours is 210850 obama well let me talk specifically about what i think we need to do first weve got to improve our education system and weve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from democrats and republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools weve got a program called race to the top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country raising standards improving how we train teachers so now i want to hire another 100000 new math and science teachers and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now and i want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people when it comes to our tax code governor romney and i both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high so i want to lower it particularly for manufacturing taking it down to 25 percent but i also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas i want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the united states on energy governor romney and i we both agree that weve got to boost american energy production and oil and natural gas production are higher than theyve been in years but i also believe that weve got to look at the energy sources of the future like wind and solar and biofuels and make those investments so all of this is possible now in order for us to do it we do have to close our deficit and one of the things im sure well be discussing tonight is how do we deal with our tax code and how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way but also how do we have enough revenue to make those investments and this is where theres a difference because governor romneys central economic plan calls for a 5 trillion tax cut on top of the extension of the bush tax cuts thats another trillion dollars and 2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasnt asked for thats 8 trillion how we pay for that reduce the deficit and make the investments that we need to make without dumping those costs onto middleclass americans i think is one of the central questions of this campaign 211103 lehrer both of you have spoken about a lot of different things and were going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can but first governor romney do you have a question that youd like to ask the president directly about something he just said 211103 romney well sure id like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece first of all i dont have a 5 trillion tax cut i dont have a tax cut of a scale that youre talking about my view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class but im not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by highincome people highincome people are doing just fine in this economy theyll do fine whether youre president or i am the people who are having the hard time right now are middle income americans under the presidents policies middleincome americans have been buried theyre just being crushed middle income americans have seen their income come down by 4300 this is a this is a tax in and of itself ill call it the economy tax its been crushing at the same time gasoline prices have doubled under the president electric rates are up food prices are up health care costs have gone up by 2500 a family middleincome families are being crushed and so the question is how to get them going again and ive described it its energy and trade the right kind of training programs balancing our budget and helping small business those are the the cornerstones of my plan but the president mentioned a couple of other ideas ill just note first education i agree education is key particularly the future of our economy but our training programs right now weve got 47 of them housed in the federal government reporting to eight different agencies overhead is overwhelming weve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them the second area taxation we agree we ought to bring the tax rates down and i do both for corporations and for individuals but in order for us not to lose revenue have the government run out of money i also lower deductions and credits and exemptions so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth the third area energy energy is critical and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the us is up but not due to his policies in spite of his policies mr president all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land not on government land on government land your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half if im president ill double them and also get the the oil from offshore and alaska and ill bring that pipeline in from canada and by the way i like coal im going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal people in the coal industry feel like its getting crushed by your policies i want to get america and north america energy independent so we can create those jobs and finally with regards to that tax cut look im not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the the revenues going to the government my my numberone principal is there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit i want to underline that no tax cut that adds to the deficit but i do want to reduce the burden being paid by middleincome americans and i and to do that that also means i cannot reduce the burden paid by highincome americans so any any language to the contrary is simply not accurate lehrer mr president 211422 obama well i think lets talk about taxes because i think its instructive now four years ago when i stood on this stage i said that i would cut taxes for middleclass families and thats exactly what i did we cut taxes for middleclass families by about 3600 and the reason is because i believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well and by giving them those tax cuts they had a little more money in their pocket and so maybe they can buy a new car they are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through they can buy a computer for their kid whos going off to college which means theyre spending more money businesses have more customers businesses make more profits and then hire more workers now governor romneys proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a 5 trillion tax cut on top of 2 trillion of additional spending for our military and he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions the problem is that hes been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes and he hasnt been able to identify them but im going to make an important point here jim 211634 lehrer all right 211636 obama when you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upperincome individuals can are currently taking advantage of you take those all away you dont come close to paying for 5 trillion in tax cuts and 2 trillion in additional military spending obama and thats why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet governor romneys pledge of not reducing the deficit or or or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middleclass families the average middleclass family with children would pay about 2000 more now thats not my analysis thats the analysis of economists who have looked at this and and that kind of top topdown economics where folks at the top are doing well so the average person making 3 million is getting a 250000 tax break while middleclass families are burdened further thats not what i believe is a recipe for economic growth 211637 lehrer all right what is the difference lets just stay on taxes crosstalk lehrer just lets just stay on taxes for inaudible crosstalk lehrer what is the difference 211642 romney well but but virtually virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate 211643 lehrer all right 211644 romney so if the tax plan he described were a tax plan i was asked to support id say absolutely not im not looking for a 5 trillion tax cut what ive said is i wont put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit thats part one so theres no economist that can say mitt romneys tax plan adds 5 trillion if i say i will not add to the deficit with my tax plan number two i will not reduce the share paid by highincome individuals i know that you and your running mate keep saying that and i know its a popular thing to say with a lot of people but its just not the case look ive got five boys im used to people saying something thats not always true but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping ill believe it but that that is not the case all right i will not reduce the taxes paid by highincome americans and number three i will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middleincome families i will lower taxes on middleincome families now you cite a study there are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say its completely wrong i saw a study that came out today that said youre going to raise taxes by 3000 to 4000 on middleincome families there are all these studies out there but lets get at the bottom line that is i want to bring down rates i want to bring the rates down at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth so we keep getting the revenue we need and youd think well then why lower the rates and the reason is because small business pays that individual rate 54 percent of americas workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate but at the individual tax rate and if we lower that rate they will be able to hire more people for me this is about jobs this is about getting jobs for the american people crosstalk 211830 lehrer thats where we started yeah do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan 211834 obama well for 18 months hes been running on this tax plan and now five weeks before the election hes saying that his big bold idea is never mind and the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described governor then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect highincome individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class its its math its arithmetic now governor romney and i do share a deep interest in encouraging smallbusiness growth so at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families i also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times and what i want to do is continue the tax rates the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families but i have said that for incomes over 250000 a year that we should go back to the rates that we had when bill clinton was president when we created 23 million new jobs went from deficit to surplus and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot and the reason this is important is because by doing that we cannot only reduce the deficit we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses but were also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy and we do have a difference though when it comes to definitions of small business under under my plan 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up governor romney says well those top 3 percent theyre the job creators theyd be burdened but under governor romneys definition there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses donald trump is a small business now i know donald trump doesnt like to think of himself as small anything but but thats how you define small businesses if youre getting business income and that kind of approach i believe will not grow our economy because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research all the things that are helping america grow and i think that would be a mistake 212101 lehrer all right 212103 romney jim let me just come back on that on that point which is these 212104 lehrer just for the just for record crosstalk 212107 romney the small businesses were talking about 212109 lehrer excuse me excuse me just so everybody understands were way over our first 15 minutes 212110 romney its fun isnt it 212111 lehrer its ok its great no problem well you all dont have you dont have a problem i dont have a problem because were still on the economy were going to come back to taxes i want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things too ok but go ahead sir 212138 romney you bet well president youre mr president youre absolutely right which is that with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate theyre taxed at a lower rate but those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half half of all the people who work in small business those are the businesses that employ onequarter of all the workers in america and your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent now and and ive talked to a guy who has a very small business hes in the electronics business in in st louis he has four employees he said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes federal income tax federal payroll tax state income tax state sales tax state property tax gasoline tax it added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned and your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent the national federation of independent businesses has said that will cost 700000 jobs i dont want to cost jobs my priority is jobs and so what i do is i bring down the tax rates lower deductions and exemptions the same idea behind bowlessimpson by the way get the rates down lower deductions and exemptions to create more jobs because theres nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working earning more money paying more taxes thats by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced 212258 obama jim i you may want to move onto another topic but i i would just say this to the american people if you believe that we can cut taxes by 5 trillion and add 2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for 7 trillion just to give you a sense over 10 years thats more than our entire defense budget and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the welltodo somehow you will not end up picking up the tab then governor romneys plan may work for you but i think math common sense and our history shows us thats not a recipe for job growth look weve tried this weve tried both approaches the approach that governor romneys talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003 and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years we ended up moving from surplus to deficits and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the great depression bill clinton tried the approach that im talking about we created 23 million new jobs we went from deficit to surplus and businesses did very well so in some ways weve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for americans and i believe that the economy works best when middleclass families are getting tax breaks so that theyve got some money in their pockets and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure were not blowing up the deficit 212440 romney jim the president began this segment so i think i get the last word crosstalk 212442 lehrer well youre going to get the first word in the next segment 212448 romney all right well but he gets the first word of that segment i get the last word inaudible i hope let me just make this comment crosstalk 212450 romney i think first of all let me let me repeat let me repeat what i said im not in favor of a 5 trillion tax cut thats not my plan my plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit thats point one so you may keep referring to it as a 5 trillion tax cut but thats not my plan number two lets look at history my plan is not like anything thats been tried before my plan is to bring down rates but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in but that we bring down rates to get more people working my priority is putting people back to work in america theyre suffering in this country and we talk about evidence look at the evidence of the last four years its absolutely extraordinary weve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country its just its weve got when the president took office 32 million people on food stamps 47 million on food stamps today economic growth this year slower than last year and last year slower than the year before going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the american people who are struggling today 212601 lehrer all right lets talk were still on the economy this is theoretically now a second segment still on the economy and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit the federal debt and the question you each have two minutes on this and governor romney you you go first because the president went first on segment one and the question is this what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country 212631 romney good im glad you raised that and its a its a critical issue i think its not just an economic issue i think its a moral issue i think its frankly not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and theyre going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives and the amount of debt were adding at a trillion a year is simply not moral so how do we deal with it well mathematically there are three ways that you can cut a deficit one of course is to raise taxes number two is to cut spending and number is to grow the economy because if more people work in a growing economy theyre paying taxes and you can get the job done that way the presidents would president would prefer raising taxes i understand the problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth and you could never quite get the job done i want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time what things would i cut from spending well first of all i will eliminate all programs by this test if they dont pass it is the program so critical its worth borrowing money from china to pay for it and if not ill get rid of it obamacares on my list i apologize mr president i use that term with all respect by the way obama i like it romney good ok good so ill get rid of that im sorry jim im going to stop the subsidy to pbs im going to stop other things i like pbs i love big bird actually like you too but im not going to im not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from china to pay for thats number one number two ill take programs that are currently good programs but i think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state number three ill make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees combine some agencies and departments my cutbacks will be done through attrition by the way this is the approach we have to take to get america to a balanced budget the president said hed cut the deficit in half unfortunately he doubled it trilliondollar deficits for the last four years the presidents put it in place as much public debt almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined 212835 lehrer mr president two minutes 212837 obama when i walked into the oval office i had more than a trilliondollar deficit greeting me and we know where it came from two wars that were paid for on a credit card two tax cuts that were not paid for and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for and then a massive economic crisis and despite that what weve said is yes we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didnt slip into a great depression but what weve also said is lets make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow so 77 government programs everything from aircrafts that the air force had ordered but werent working very well 18 government 18 government programs for education that were wellintentioned not werent helping kids learn we went after medical fraud in medicare and medicaid very aggressively more aggressively than ever before and have saved tens of billions of dollars 50 billion of waste taken out of the system and i worked with democrats and republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget thats the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since dwight eisenhower now we all know that weve got to do more and so ive put forward a specific 4 trillion deficit reduction plan its on a website you can look at all the numbers what cuts we make and what revenue we raise and the way we do it is 250 for every cut we ask for 1 of additional revenue paid for as i indicated earlier by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit governor romney earlier mentioned the bowlessimpson commission well thats how the commission bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts and this is a major difference that governor romney and i have let let me just finish their point because youre looking for contrast you know when governor romney stood on a stage with other republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked would you take 10 of spending cuts for just 1 of revenue and he said no now if you take such an unbalanced approach then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education it means that governor romney crosstalk 213115 obama talked about medicaid and how we could send it back to the states but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes for kids who are with disabilities 213122 lehrer mr president im sorry 213126 obama and and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward 213128 lehrer way over the two minutes 213128 obama sorry 213134 lehrer governor what about simpsonbowles do you support simpsonbowles 213134 romney simpsonbowles the president should have grabbed that 213135 lehrer no i mean do you support simpsonbowles 213136 romney i have my own plan its not the same as simpson bowles but in my view the president should have grabbed it if you wanted to make some adjustments to it take it go to congress fight for it 213148 obama thats what weve done made some adjustments to it and were putting it forward before congress right now a 4 trillion plan romney but youve been but youve been president four years crosstalk 213154 romney youve been president four years you said youd cut the deficit in half its now four years later we still have trilliondollar deficits the cbo says well have a trilliondollar deficit each of the next four years if youre reelected well get to a trilliondollar debt i mean you have said before youd cut the deficit in half and this i love this idea of 4 trillion in cuts you found 4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget except we still show trilliondollar deficits every year that doesnt get the job done let me come back and say why is it that i dont want to raise taxes why dont i want to raise taxes on people and actually you said it back in 2010 you said look im going to extend the tax policies that we have now im not going to raise taxes on anyone because when the economy is growing slow like this when were in recession you shouldnt raise taxes on anyone well the economy is still growing slow as a matter of fact its growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement and so if you believe the same thing you just dont want to raise taxes on people and the reality is its not just wealthy people you mentioned donald trump its not just donald trump youre taxing its all those businesses that employ onequarter of the workers in america these small businesses that are taxed as individuals you raise taxes and you kill jobs thats why the national federation of independent businesses said your plan will kill 700000 jobs i dont want to kill jobs in this environment ill make one more point crosstalk 213321 lehrer inaudible answer the taxes thing for a moment 213322 romney ok 213323 lehrer mr president 213324 obama well weve had this discussion before 213326 lehrer about the idea that in order to reduce the deficit there has to be revenue in addition to cuts 213330 obama there has to be revenue in addition to cuts now governor romney has ruled out revenue hes ruled out revenue crosstalk 213331 romney absolutely crosstalk 213330 romney look the revenue i get is by more people working getting higher pay paying more taxes thats how we get growth and how we balance the budget but the idea of taxing people more putting more people out of work youll never get there youll never balance the budget by raising taxes spain spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government were now spending 42 percent of our economy on government i dont want to go down the path to spain i want to go down the path of growth that puts americans to work with more money coming in because theyre working 213411 lehrer but but mr president youre saying in order to to get the job done its got to be balanced youve got to have crosstalk 213416 obama if if were serious weve got to take a balanced responsible approach and by the way this is not just when it comes to individual taxes lets talk about corporate taxes now ive identified areas where we can right away make a change that i believe would actually help the economy the oil industry gets 4 billion a year in corporate welfare basically they get deductions that those small businesses that governor romney refers to they dont get now does anybody think that exxonmobil needs some extra money when theyre making money every time you go to the pump why wouldnt we want to eliminate that why wouldnt we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets my attitude is if you got a corporate jet you can probably afford to pay full freight not get a special break for it when it comes to corporate taxes governor romney has said he wants to in a revenue neutral way close loopholes deductions he hasnt identified which ones they are but that thereby bring down the corporate rate well i want to do the same thing but ive actually identified how we can do that and part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas right now you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas i think most americans would say that doesnt make sense and all that raises revenue and so if we take a balanced approach what that then allows us to do is also to help young people the way we already have during my administration make sure that they can afford to go to college it means that the teacher that i met in las vegas a wonderful young lady who describes to me shes got 42 kids in her class the first two weeks shes got them some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned theyre using text books that are 10 years old that is not a recipe for growth thats not how america was built and so budgets reflect choices ultimately were going to have to make some decisions and if were asking for no revenue then that means that weve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff and the magnitude of the tax cuts that youre talking about governor would end up resulting in severe hardship for people but more importantly would not help us grow as i indicated before when you talk about shifting medicaid to states were talking about potentially a 30 a 30 percent cut in medicaid over time now you know that may not seem like a big deal when it just is you know numbers on a sheet of paper but if were talking about a family whos got an autistic kid and is depending on that medicaid thats a big problem and governors are creative theres no doubt about it but theyre not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like medicaid what ends up happening is some people end up not getting help 213719 romney jim lets weve gone on a lot of topics there and so its going to take a minute to go from medicaid to schools 213722 lehrer come back to crosstalk 213725 romney to oil to tax breaks then companies going overseas so lets go through them one by one first of all the department of energy has said the tax break for oil companies is 28 billion a year and its actually an accounting treatment as you know thats been in place for a hundred years now obama its time to end it romney and in one year you provided 90 billion in breaks to the green energy world now i like green energy as well but thats about 50 years worth of what oil and gas receives and you say exxon and mobil actually this 28 billion goes largely to small companies to drilling operators and so forth but you know if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent why that 28 billion is on the table of course its on the table thats probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent but dont forget you put 90 billion like 50 years worth of breaks into into solar and wind to solyndra and fisker and tester and ener1 i mean i had a friend who said you dont just pick the winners and losers you pick the losers all right so this this is not this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get america energy secure the second topic which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas look ive been in business for 25 years i have no idea what youre talking about i maybe need to get a new accountant lehrer lets romney but but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case crosstalk romney what we do have right now is a setting where id like to bring money from overseas back to this country and finally medicaid to states im not quite sure where that came in except this which is i would like to take the medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state youre going to get what you got last year plus inflation plus 1 percent and then youre going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best and i remember as a governor when this idea was floated by tommy thompson the governors republican and democrats said please let us do that we can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor so so lets state one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy dont have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of medicaid they have to have let states do this and by the way if a state gets in trouble well we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them 213949 lehrer lets go 213948 romney but but the right the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states not the federal government 213952 lehrer inaudible and were going on still on the economy on another but another part of it obama ok 213956 lehrer all right all right this is segment three the economy entitlements first first answer goes to you two minutes mr president do you see a major difference between the two of you on social security 214015 obama you know i suspect that on social security weve got a somewhat similar position social security is structurally sound its going to have to be tweaked the way it was by ronald reagan and speaker democratic speaker tip oneill but it is the basic structure is sound but but i want to talk about the values behind social security and medicare and then talk about medicare because thats the big driver of our deficits right now you know my grandmother some of you know helped to raise me my grandparents did my grandfather died a while back my grandmother died three days before i was elected president and she was fiercely independent she worked her way up only had a high school education started as a secretary ended up being the vice president of a local bank and she ended up living alone by choice and the reason she could be independent was because of social security and medicare she had worked all her life put in this money and understood that there was a basic guarantee a floor under which she could not go and thats the perspective i bring when i think about whats called entitlements you know the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks these are folks whove worked hard like my grandmother and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this so my approach is to say how do we strengthen the system over the long term and in medicare what we did was we said we are going to have to bring down the costs if were going to deal with our longterm deficits but to do that lets look where some of the moneys going 716 billion we were able to save from the medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we werent overpaying providers and using that money we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of 600 and we were also able to make a make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the throughout the system so the way for us to deal with medicare in particular is to lower health care costs when it comes to social security as i said you dont need a major structural change in order to make sure that social security is there for the future 214238 lehrer well follow up on this first governor romney you have two minutes on social security and entitlements 214241 romney well jim our seniors depend on these programs and i know anytime we talk about entitlements people become concerned that somethings going to happen thats going to change their life for the worse and the answer is neither the president nor i are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees either to social security or medicare so if youre 60 or around 60 or older you dont need to listen any further but for younger people we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring oh i just thought about one and that is in fact i was wrong when i said the president isnt proposing any changes for current retirees in fact he is on medicare on social security hes not but on medicare for current retirees hes cutting 716 billion from the program now he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers actually just going to them and saying were going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board everybodys going to get a lower rate thats not just going after places where theres abuse thats saying were cutting the rates some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they wont take anymore medicare patients under that scenario we also have 50 percent of doctors who say they wont take more medicare patients this we have 4 million people on medicare advantage that will lose medicare advantage because of those 716 billion in cuts i cant understand how you can cut medicare 716 billion for current recipients of medicare now you point out well were putting some back were going to give a better prescription program thats 1 thats 1 for every 15 youve cut theyre smart enough to know thats not a good trade i want to take that 716 billion youve cut and put it back into medicare by the way we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it but the idea of cutting 716 billion from medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of obamacare is in my opinion a mistake and with regards to young people coming along ive got proposals to make sure medicare and social security are there for them without any question 214443 lehrer mr president 214444 obama first of all i think its important for governor romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future and the essence of the plan is that you would turn medicare into a voucher program its called premium support but its understood to be a voucher program his running mate 214505 lehrer and you dont support that 214507 obama i dont and let me explain why 214508 romney again thats for future 214509 obama i understand 214510 romney people right not for current retirees 214512 obama for so if youre if youre 54 or 55 you might want to listen cause this this will affect you the idea which was originally presented by congressman ryan your running mate is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance the problem is that because the voucher wouldnt necessarily keep up with health care inflation it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about 6000 a year now in fairness what governor romney has now said is hell maintain traditional medicare alongside it but theres still a problem because what happens is those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors they recruit them leaving the older sicker seniors in medicare and every health care economist that looks at it says over time whatll happen is the traditional medicare system will collapse and then what youve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care so i dont think vouchers are the right way to go and this is not my own only my opinion aarp thinks that the the savings that we obtained from medicare bolster the system lengthen the medicare trust fund by eight years benefits were not affected at all and ironically if you repeal obamacare and i have become fond of this term obamacare if you repeal it what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying 600 more in prescription care theyre now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier and the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they arent making seniors any healthier and i dont think thats the right approach when it comes to making sure that medicare is stronger over the long term 214721 lehrer well talk about specifically about health care in a moment but what do you support the voucher system governor 214727 romney what i support is no change for current retirees and nearretirees to medicare and the president supports taking 716 billion out of that program 214732 lehrer and what about the vouchers crosstalk 214736 romney so thats thats number one number two is for people coming along that are young what i do to make sure that we can keep medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current medicare program or a private plan their choice they get to choose and theyll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them so they dont have to pay additional money no additional 6000 thats not going to happen theyll have at least two plans and by the way if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector people will be happy to get traditional medicare or theyll be able to get a private plan i know my own view is id rather have a private plan id just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care i get id rather be able to have an insurance company if i dont like them i can get rid of them and find a different insurance company but people make their own choice the other thing we have to do to save medicare we have to have the benefits high for those that are low income but for higher income people were going to have to lower some of the benefits we have to make sure this program is there for the long term thats the plan that ive put forward and by the way the idea came not even from paul ryan or or senator wyden whos the coauthor of the bill with with paul ryan in the senate but also it came from bill bill clintons chief of staff this is an idea thats been around a long time which is saying hey lets see if we cant get competition into the medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost better quality i believe in competition 214905 obama jim if i if i can just respond very quickly first of all every study has shown that medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it and private insurers have to make a profit nothing wrong with that thats what they do and so youve got higher administrative costs plus profit on top of that and if you are going to save any money through what governor romneys proposing what has to happen is is that the money has to come from somewhere and when you move to a voucher system you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies and over time if traditional medicare has decayed or fallen apart then theyre stuck and this is the reason why aarp has said that your plan would weaken medicare substantially and thats why they were supportive of the approach that we took one last point i want to make we do have to lower the cost of health care not just in medicare and medicaid lehrer talk about that in a minute obama but but but overall lehrer ok obama and so romney thats thats a big topic can we can we stay on medicare obama is that a is that a separate topic crosstalk lehrer yeah were going to yeah i want to get to it obama im sorry lehrer but all i want to do is go very quickly romney lets get back to medicare lehrer before we leave the economy romney lets get back to medicare crosstalk 215020 romney the president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit 215025 lehrer all right 215027 romney if thats the case then it will always be the best product that people can purchase 215030 lehrer wait a minute governor 215032 romney but my experience my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost 215038 lehrer all right can we can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice a clear choice between the two 215040 romney absolutely lehrer of you on medicare romney absolutely obama absolutely 215042 lehrer all right so to finish quickly briefly on the economy what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now is there too much and in your case mr president is there should there be more beginning with you this is not a new twominute segment to start and well go for a few minutes and then were going to go to health care ok 215107 romney regulation is essential you cant have a free market work if you dont have regulation as a businessperson i had to have i need to know the regulations i needed them there you couldnt have people opening up banks in their in their garage and making loans i mean you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work every free economy has good regulation at the same time regulation can become excessive 215130 lehrer is it excessive now do you think 215131 romney in some places yes other places no 215132 lehrer like where crosstalk 215137 romney no it can become out of date and whats happened with some of the legislation thats been passed during the presidents term youve seen regulation become excessive and its hurt its hurt the economy let me give you an example doddfrank was passed and it includes within it a number of provisions that i think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy one is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail and theyre effectively guaranteed by the federal government this is the biggest kiss thats been given to to new york banks ive ever seen this is an enormous boon for them thereve been 122 community and small banks have closed since dodd frank so theres one example heres another in doddfrank 215215 lehrer do you want to repeal doddfrank 215217 romney well i would repeal and replace it were not going to get rid of all regulation you have to have regulation and there are some parts of doddfrank that make all the sense in the world you need transparency you need to have leverage limits for 215225 lehrer well heres a specific crosstalk 215228 romney but lets lets mention let me mention the other one lets talk crosstalk 215233 lehrer no lets not lets let him respond lets let him respond to this specific on doddfrank and what the governor just said 215241 obama i think this is a great example the reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board now it wasnt just on wall street you had loan officers were that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldnt have been given because the folks didnt qualify you had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldnt afford you had credit agencies that were stamping these as a1 great investments when they werent but you also had banks making money hand over fist churning out products that the bankers themselves didnt even understand in order to make big profits but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable so what did we do we stepped in and had the toughest reforms on wall street since the 1930s we said youve got banks youve got to raise your capital requirements you cant engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting main street at risk weve going to make sure that youve got to have a living will so so we can know how youre going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we dont have other taxpayer bailouts in the meantime by the way we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime with interest now governor romney has said he wants to repeal doddfrank and you know i appreciate and it appears weve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation but in the past governor romney has said he just want to repeal dodd frank roll it back and so the question is does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of wall street because if you do then governor romney is your candidate but thats not what i believe 215442 romney sorry but thats just not thats just not the facts look we have to have regulation on wall street thats why id have regulation but i wouldnt designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check thats one of the unintended consequences of doddfrank it wasnt thought through properly we need to get rid of that provision because its killing regional and small banks theyre getting hurt let me mention another regulation in doddfrank you say we were giving mortgages to people who werent qualified thats exactly right its one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had and so doddfrank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages and if you give a mortgage thats not qualified there are big penalties except they didnt ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was its been two years we dont know what a qualified mortgage is yet so banks are reluctant to make loans mortgages try and get a mortgage these days its hurt the housing market because doddfrank didnt anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have its not that doddfrank always was wrong with too much regulation sometimes they didnt come out with a clear regulation i will make sure we dont hurt the functioning of our of our marketplace and our business because i want to bring back housing and get good jobs 215555 lehrer all right i think we have another clear difference between the two of you now lets move to health care where i know there is a clear difference and that has to do with the affordable care act obamacare and its a twominute new new segment and that means two minutes each and you go first governor romney you want it repealed you want the affordable care act repealed why 215620 romney i sure do well in part it comes again from my experience you know i was in new hampshire a woman came to me and she said look i cant afford insurance for myself or my son i met a couple in appleton wisconsin and they said were thinking of dropping our insurance we cant afford it and the number of small businesses ive gone to that are saying theyre dropping insurance because they cant afford it the cost of health care is just prohibitive and and weve got to deal with cost and unfortunately when when when you look at obamacare the congressional budget office has said it will cost 2500 a year more than traditional insurance so its adding to cost and as a matter of fact when the president ran for office he said that by this year he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by 2500 a family instead its gone up by that amount so its expensive expensive things hurt families so thats one reason i dont want it second reason it cuts 716 billion from medicare to pay for it i want to put that money back in medicare for our seniors number three it puts in place an unelected board thats going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have i dont like that idea fourth there was a survey done of small businesses across the country said whats been the effect of obamacare on your hiring plans and threequarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people i just dont know how the president could have come into office facing 23 million people out of work rising unemployment an economic crisis at the at the kitchen table and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the american people it has killed jobs and the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state and then lets focus on getting the costs down for people rather than raising it with the 2500 additional premium 215819 lehrer mr president the argument against repeal 215820 obama well four years ago when i was running for office i was traveling around and having those same conversations that governor romney talks about and it wasnt just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldnt get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees it wasnt just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit our overall health care costs but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick millions of families all across the country if they had a preexisting condition they might not be able to get coverage at all if they did have coverage insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit and so as a consequence theyre paying their premiums somebody gets really sick lo and behold they dont have enough money to pay the bills because the insurance companies say that theyve hit the limit so we did work on this alongside working on jobs because this is part of making sure that middleclass families are secure in this country and let me tell you exactly what obamacare did number one if youve got health insurance it doesnt mean a government takeover you keep your own insurance you keep your own doctor but it does say insurance companies cant jerk you around they cant impose arbitrary lifetime limits they have to let you keep your kid on their insurance your insurance plan until youre 26 years old and it also says that youre going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care number two if you dont have health insurance were essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if youre out there trying to get insurance on the individual market now the last point id make before lehrer two minutes two minutes is up sir obama no i think i had five seconds before you interrupted me was laughter the irony is that weve seen this model work really well in massachusetts because governor romney did a good thing working with democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there it hasnt destroyed jobs and as a consequence we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold 220101 lehrer your five seconds went away a long time ago all right governor governor tell tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about obamacare 220110 romney well i did with my first statement crosstalk 220113 romney first of all i like the way we did it in massachusetts i like the fact that in my state we had republicans and democrats come together and work together what you did instead was to push through a plan without a single republican vote as a matter of fact when massachusetts did something quite extraordinary elected a republican senator to stop obamacare you pushed it through anyway so entirely on a partisan basis instead of bringing america together and having a discussion on this important topic you pushed through something that you and nancy pelosi and harry reid thought was the best answer and drove it through what we did in a legislature 87 percent democrat we worked together 200 legislators in my legislature only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished what were some differences we didnt raise taxes youve raised them by 1 trillion under obamacare we didnt cut medicare of course we dont have medicare but we didnt cut medicare by 716 billion we didnt put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments theyre going to receive we didnt also do something that i think a number of people across this country recognize which is put put people in a position where theyre going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted right now the cbo says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as obamacare goes into effect next year and likewise a study by mckinsey and company of american businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage so for those reasons for the tax for medicare for this board and for people losing their insurance this is why the american people dont want medicare dont want obamacare its why republicans said do not do this and the republicans had had the plan they put a plan out they put out a plan a bipartisan plan it was swept aside i think something this big this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis and we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties 220312 obama governor romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis this was a bipartisan idea in fact it was a republican idea and governor romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in massachusetts could be a model for the nation and i agree that the democratic legislators in massachusetts might have given some advice to republicans in congress about how to cooperate but the fact of the matter is we used the same advisers and they say its the same plan it when governor romney talks about this board for example unelected board that weve created what this is is a group of health care experts doctors et cetera to figure out how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall because there there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis one is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up and their workers are no longer getting insured and thats been the trend line or alternatively we can figure out how do we make the cost of care more effective and there are ways of doing it so at cleveland clinic one of the best health care systems in the world they actually provide great care cheaper than average and the reason they do is because they do some smart things they they say if a patients coming in lets get all the doctors together at once do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests lets make sure that were providing preventive care so were catching the onset of something like diabetes lets lets pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures theyve theyve engaged in now so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says lets use the purchasing power of medicare and medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do and the fact of the matter is that when obamacare is fully implemented were going to be in a position to show that costs are going down and over the last two years health care premiums have gone up its true but theyve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years so were already beginning to see progress in the meantime folks out there with insurance youre already getting a rebate let me make one last point governor romney says we should replace it im just going to repeal it but but we can replace it with something but the problem is he hasnt described what exactly wed replace it with other than saying were going to leave it to the states but the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that hes offered like letting you buy insurance across state lines theres no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody whos got a preexisting condition be able to finally buy insurance in fact its estimated that by repealing obamacare youre looking at 50 million people losing health insurance 220624 lehrer lets 220625 obama at a time when its vitally important 220626 lehrer lets let the governor explain what you would do 220627 romney well 220628 lehrer if obamacare is repealed how would you replace it crosstalk 220633 romney well actually its its its a lengthy description but number one preexisting conditions are covered under my plan number two young people are able to stay on their family plan thats already offered in the private marketplace you dont have to have the government mandate that for that to occur but lets come back to something the president and i agree on which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so its more affordable for families and then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government an unelected board appointed board who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have crosstalk in my opinion the government is not effective in in bringing down the cost of almost anything as a matter of fact free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be your example of the cleveland clinic is my case in point along with several others i could describe this is the private market these are small these are enterprises competing with each other learning how to do better and better jobs i used to consult to businesses excuse me to hospitals and to health care providers i was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the american people in order to bring the cost of health care down we dont need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have we instead need to put insurance plans providers hospitals doctors on target such that they have an incentive as you say performance pay for doing an excellent job for keeping costs down and thats happening innermountain healthcare does it superbly well mayo clinic is doing it superbly well cleveland clinic others but the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across america telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have thats the wrong way to go the private market and individual responsibility always work best 220836 obama let me just point out first of all this board that were talking about cant make decisions about what treatments are given thats explicitly prohibited in the law but lets go back to what governor romney indicated that under his plan he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions well actually governor that isnt what your plan does what your plan does is to duplicate whats already the law which says if you are out of health insurance for three months then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company cant deny you if youve if its been under 90 days but thats already the law and that doesnt help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions theres a reason why governor romney set up the plan that he did in massachusetts it wasnt a government takeover of health care it was the largest expansion of private insurance but what it does say is that insurers youve got to take everybody now that also means that youve got more customers but when when governor romney says that hell replace it with something but cant detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in massachusetts was because there isnt a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem it just reminds me of you know he says that hes going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan thats how its going to be paid for but we dont know the details he says that hes going to replace doddfrank wall street reform but we dont know exactly which ones he wont tell us he now says hes going to replace obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you dont have to worry and at some point i think the american people have to ask themselves is the reason that governor romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because theyre too good is it is it because that somehow middleclass families are going to benefit too much from them no the reason is is because when we reform wall street when we tackle the problem of preexisting conditions then you know these are tough problems and weve got to make choices and the choices weve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middleclass families all across the country 221105 lehrer were going to move to 221106 romney no i i have to respond to that 221108 lehrer no but 221110 romney which is which is my experience as a governor is if i come in and and lay down a piece of legislation and say its my way or the highway i dont get a lot done what i do is the same way that tip oneill and ronald reagan worked together some years ago when ronald reagan ran for office he laid out the principles that he was going to foster he said he was going to lower tax rates he said he was going to broaden the base youve said the same thing youre going to simplify the tax code broaden the base those are my principles i want to bring down the tax burden on middleincome families and im going to work together with congress to say ok what what are the various ways we could bring down deductions for instance one way for instance would be to have a single number make up a number 25000 50000 anybody can have deductions up to that amount and then that number disappears for highincome people thats one way one could do it one could follow bowlessimpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way there are alternatives to accomplish the objective i have which is to bring down rates broaden the base simplify the code and create incentives for growth and with regards to health care you had remarkable details with regards to my preexisting condition plan you obviously studied up on on my plan in fact i do have a plan that deals with people with preexisting conditions thats part of my health care plan and what we did in massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state and i said that at that time the federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th amendment which gives states the rights for these kinds of things is not the course for america to have a stronger more vibrant economy 221245 lehrer that is a terrific segue to our next segment and is the role of government and and lets see role of government and it is you are first on this mr president and the question is this do you believe both of you but you had the first two minutes on this mr president do you believe theres a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government 221314 obama well i definitely think there are differences 221315 lehrer and do you yeah 221316 obama the first role of the federal government is to keep the american people safe thats its most basic function and as commanderinchief that is something that ive worked on and thought about every single day that ive been in the oval office but i also believe that government has the capacity the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the american people can succeed look the genius of america is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business work on an idea make their own decisions but as abraham lincoln understood there are also some things we do better together so in the middle of the civil war abraham lincoln said lets help to finance the transcontinental railroad lets start the national academy of sciences lets start land grant colleges because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all americans because if all americans are getting opportunity were all going to be better off that doesnt restrict peoples freedom that enhances it and so what ive tried to do as president is to apply those same principles and when it comes to education what ive said is weve got to reform schools that are not working we use something called race to the top wasnt a topdown approach governor what weve said is to states well give you more money if you initiate reforms and as a consequence you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference but what ive also said is lets hire another 100000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed and hardpressed states right now cant all do that in fact weve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years and governor romney doesnt think we need more teachers i do because i think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help it cant do it all but it can make a difference and as a consequence well have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where weve got a skilled workforce 221540 lehrer two minutes governor on the role of government your view 221543 romney well first i love great schools massachusetts our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states and the key to great schools great teachers so i reject the idea that i dont believe in great teachers or more teachers every school district every state should make that decision on their own the role of government look behind us the constitution and the declaration of independence the role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents first life and liberty we have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people and that means a military second to none i do not believe in cutting our military i believe in maintaining the strength of americas military second in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights i believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country that statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose i interpret that as one making sure that those people who are less fortunate and cant care for themselves are cared by by one another were a nation that believes that were all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties those that are elderly and have problems and challenges those that are disabled we care for them and we we look for discovery and innovation all these things desired out of the american heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens but we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals and what were seeing right now is in my view a a trickledown government approach which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams and its not working and the proof of that is 23 million people out of work the proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty the proof of that is weve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps the proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year cant find work 221748 lehrer all right 221749 romney we know that the path were taking is not working its time for a new path 221750 lehrer all right lets go through some specifics in terms of what how each of you views the role of government how do education does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in america 221803 romney well the primary responsibility for education is is of course at the state and local level but the federal government also can play a very important role and i and i agree with secretary arne duncan hes some ideas hes put forward on race to the top not all of them but some of them i agree with and and congratulate him for pursuing that the federal government can get local and and state schools to do a better job my own view by the way is ive added to that i happen to believe i want the kids that are getting federal dollars from idea or title i these are disabled kids or or or poor kids or or lowerincome kids rather i want them to be able to go to the school of their choice so all federal funds instead of going to the to the state or to the school district id have go if you will follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their their their student 221850 lehrer how do you see the federal governments responsibility to as i say to improve the quality of public education in this country 221857 obama well as ive indicated i think that it has a significant role to play through our race to the top program weve worked with republican and democratic governors to initiate major reforms and theyre having an impact right now 221920 lehrer do you think you have a difference with your views and and those of governor romney on about education and the federal government 221925 obama you know this is where budgets matter because budgets reflect choices so when governor romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him and to pay for it were having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education that makes a difference you know his his running mate congressman ryan put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that governor romneys talked about and it wasnt very detailed this seems to be a trend but but what it did do is to if you extrapolated how much money were talking about youd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent when it comes to community colleges we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now and one of the things i suspect governor romney and i probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that theyre setting up their training programs 222020 lehrer do you do you agree governor 222021 obama let me just finish the point crosstalk 222023 obama the where theyre partnering so that theyre designing training programs and people who are going through them know that theres a job waiting for them if they complete it that makes a big difference but that requires some federal support let me just say one final example when it comes to making college affordable whether its twoyear or fouryear one of the things that i did as president was we were sending 60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program even though the loans were guaranteed so there was no risk for the banks or the lenders but they were taking billions out of the system and we said why not cut out the middleman and as a consequence what weve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance lower or keep low interest rates on student loans and this is an example of where our priorities make a difference governor romney i genuinely believe cares about education but when he tells a student that you know you should borrow money from your parents to go to college you know that indicates the degree to which you know there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself folks like michelle kids probably who attend university of denver just dont have that option and for us to be able to make sure that theyve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door that is vitally important not just to those kids its how were going to grow this economy over the long term 222159 lehrer were running out of time gentlemen crosstalk lehrer governor 222205 romney mr president mr president youre entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house but not to your own facts all right im not going to cut education funding i dont have any plan to cut education funding and and grants that go to people going to college im planning on inaudible to grow so im not planning on making changes there but you make a very good point which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is you put 90 billion into into green jobs and i look im all in favor of green energy 90 billion that would have that would have hired 2 million teachers 90 billion and these businesses many of them have gone out of business i think about half of them of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business a number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns look the right course for americas government we were talking about the role of government is not to become the economic player picking winners and losers telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long long time and has produced the best health records in the world the right answer for government is say how do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective how do we get schools to be more competitive lets grade them i propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing so they can take their child to a to a school that hes being more successful i dont want to cut our commitment to education i wanted to make it more effective and efficient and by the way ive had that experience i dont just talk about it ive been there massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation this is not because i didnt have commitment to education its because i care about education for all of our kids 222349 lehrer all right gentlemen crosstalk 222351 lehrer excuse me inaudible excuse me sir weve got weve got barely have three minutes left im not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or ive done a poor job obama youve done a great job lehrer oh well no but the fact is government the role of government and governing weve lost a pod in other words so we only have three three minutes left in the in the debate before we go to your closing statements and so i want to ask finally here and remember weve got three minutes total time here and the question is this many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock if elected in your case if reelected in your case what would you do about that governor 222441 romney jim i had the great experience it didnt seem like it at the time of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent democrat and that meant i figured out from day one i had to get along and i had to work across the aisle to get anything done we drove our schools to be number one in the nation we cut taxes 19 times 222450 lehrer but what would you do as president 222450 romney we as president i will sit on day one actually the day after i get elected ill sit down with leaders the democratic leaders as well as republican leaders and continue as we did in my state we met every monday for a couple hours talked about the issues and the challenges in the in the in our state in that case we have to work on a collaborative basis not because were going to compromise our principle but because theres common ground and the challenges america faces right now look the reason im in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country and we face this deficit could crush the future generations whats happening in the middle east there are developments around the world that are of real concern 222553 lehrer all right 222553 romney and republicans and democrats both love america but we need to have leadership leadership in washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if if its a republican or a democrat ive done it before ill do it again 222556 lehrer mr president 222557 obama well first of all i think governor romneys going to have a busy first day because hes also going to repeal obamacare which will not be very popular among democrats as youre sitting down with them laughter but look my philosophy has been i will take ideas from anybody democrat or republican as long as theyre advancing the cause of making middleclass families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class thats how we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses thats how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasnt advancing that cause thats how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more american products around the world thats how we repealed dont askdont tell thats how we ended the war in iraq as i promised and thats how were going to wind down the war in afghanistan thats how we went after al qaida and bin laden so weve weve seen progress even under republican control of the house of representatives but ultimately part of being principled part of being a leader is a being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do not just saying ill sit down but you have to have a plan number two whats important is occasionally youve got to say no to to to folks both in your own party and in the other party and you know yes have we had some fights between me and the republicans when when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of wall street absolutely because that was a fight that needed to be had when when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no yes that was a fight that we needed to have lehrer all right obama and so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for but also being willing to say no to some things and ive got to tell you governor romney when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party 222753 lehrer that brings us to closing statements it was a coin toss governor romney you won the toss and you elected to go last so you have a closing two minutes mr president 222805 obama well jim i want to thank you and i want to thank governor romney because i think was a terrific debate and i very much appreciate it and i want to thank the university of denver you know four years ago we were going through a major crisis and yet my faith and confidence in the american future is undiminished and the reason is because of its people because of the woman i met in north carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that shes gotten because a company in minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didnt lay off workers during a recession the auto workers that you meet in toledo or detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world not just because of a paycheck but because it gives them that sense of pride that theyre helping to build america and so the question now is how do we build on those strengths and everything that ive tried to do and everything that im now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing american energy or making sure that were closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the united states or closing our deficit in a responsible balanced way that allows us to invest in our future all those things are designed to make sure that the american people their genius their grit their determination is is channeled and and they have an opportunity to succeed and everybodys getting a fair shot and everybodys getting a fair share everybodys doing a fair share and everybodys playing by the same rules you know four years ago i said that im not a perfect man and i wouldnt be a perfect president and thats probably a promise that governor romney thinks ive kept but i also promised that id fight every single day on behalf of the american people the middle class and all those who were striving to get into the middle class ive kept that promise and if youll vote for me then i promise ill fight just as hard in a second term 223017 lehrer governor romney your twominute closing 223018 romney thank you jim and mr president and thank you for tuning in this evening this is a this is an important election and im concerned about america im concerned about the direction america has been taking over the last four years i i know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals its bigger than our respective parties its an election about the course of america what kind of america do you want to have for yourself and for your children and there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening and over the course of this month were going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate were talk about those two paths but they lead in very different directions and its not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go you can look at the record theres no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected youll continue to see a middleclass squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up ill get incomes up again youll see chronic unemployment weve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent if im president i will create help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes if the presidents reelected obamacare will be fully installed in my view thats going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past many will lose it youre going to see health premiums go up by some 2500 per family if im elected we wont have obama well put in place the kind of principles that i put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and well focus on getting the cost of health care down if the president were to be reelected youre going to see a 716 billion cut to medicare youll have 4 million people who will lose medicare advantage youll have hospital and providers thatll no longer accept medicare patients ill restore that 716 billion to medicare and finally military the presidents reelected youll see dramatic cuts to our military the secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating i will not cut our commitment to our military i will keep america strong and get americas middle class working again thank you jim lehrer thank you governor thank you mr president the next debate will be the vice presidential event on thursday october 11th at centre college in danville kentucky for now from the university of denver im jim lehrer thank you and good night applause

politifact3581,1,hannity says obama wont even use the term war on terrorism on sean hannitys fox news show on nov 9 2009 the topic was what the government knew about fort hood psychiatrist nidal malik hasan an army major who authorities say killed 13 people and wounded 30 others there is a chance our government knew all about this guy hasan and did nothing because nobody wanted to be called an islamaphobe hannity said now this is a terrorist act hannity said what does that say about barack obama and our government heres the point hannity said barack obama wont even use the term war on terrorism because hes apologizing to america in every muslim country he can weve heard a number of conservative radio and talk show hosts criticize president obama for not using the global war on terrorism phrase adopted by his predecessor george w bush and so we decided to check it out we did a word search of obamas public statements and could not find that obama has used the phrase war on terrorism as president though he said it numerous times as a candidate and early in his presidency obama used the phrase war on terror but only a couple of times sign up for politifact texts so what gives we found two instances where obama directly addressed the question the first was during a jan 27 2009 interview by hisham melhem with alaribiya an arabiclanguage television news station melhem noted that obama seemed to eschew bushs phrase war on terror and frame it in a different way specifically against one group called alqaida and their collaborators obama i think that youre making a very important point and that is that the language we use matters and what we need to understand is is that there are extremist organizations whether muslim or any other faith in the past that will use faith as a justification for violence we cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faiths name and so you will i think see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like alqaida that espouse violence espouse terror and act on it and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop we can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful i cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians and we will hunt them down but to the broader muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship the issue was again raised in a feb 3 2009 interview with cnns anderson cooper cooper ive noticed you dont use the term war on terror i think i read an article that youve only used it once since inauguration is that conscious is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful obama well you know i think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations but that those organizations arent representative of a broader arab community muslim community you know words matter in this situation because one of the ways were going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds cooper so thats not a term youre going to be using much in the future obama you know what i want to do is make sure that im constantly talking about alqaida and other affiliated organizations because we i believe can win over moderate muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life so obama isnt fond of the phrase war on terror but did that ever become blanket white house policy according to a washington post story in march a memo emailed to pentagon staff members from the defense departments office of security review said this administration prefers to avoid using the term long war or global war on terror please use overseas contingency operation according to the memo the direction came from the white house office of management and budget which reviews speeches given by administration officials kenneth baer an omb spokesman told the washington post there was no such guidance that it was only the opinion of a career civil servant still you dont hear administration officials using the term war on terror or the like very often obama was criticized in some circles when he failed to even utter the words terror or terrorism in a june 4 2009 speech in cairo egypt directed to muslims around the world the absence of those words goes to the heart of obamas new approach said john o brennan assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism who provided perhaps the clearest and most indepth explanation of the white house lexicon in a speech at the center for strategic and international studies on aug 6 2009 as many have noted the president does not describe this as a war on terrorism instead as the president has made clear we are at war with alqaida which attacked us on 911 and killed 3000 people we are at war with its violent extremist allies who seek to carry on alqaidas murderous agenda these are the terrorists we will destroy these are the extremists we will defeat brennan warned that it would be wrong for people to conclude that obama is not committed to fighting terrorism president obama has articulated a clear policy to disrupt dismantle and defeat alqaida and its allies brennan said that is our mission and the president described it in no uncertain terms in his inaugural when he said our nation is at war against a farreaching network of violence and hatred and to win this war against alqaida the administration continues to be unrelenting using every tool in our toolbox and every arrow in our quiver our aim here is not to wade into the war of words over the war on terror rather we just wanted to see if hannity was right that obama wont use the term war on terrorism and except in a couple of instances where he used the phrase war on terror obama has generally employed different words and its deliberate as he has explained on several occasions obama provides nuanced explanations for his word choices and you may agree or disagree with them but the bottom line is that obama has chosen not to use the phrase war on terrorism and so we rate hannitys statement true

his brother i talked to kanye the other day just to tell him like hes my brother he recalled i love kanye i do its a complicated relationship with us still jayz admitted that theres currently tension between the two but that happens he stressed in the long relationship you know hopefully when were 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that theres gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through and the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say these are the things that im uncomfortable with these are the things that are unacceptable to me this is what i feel im sure he feels that ive done things to him as well im not a perfect human being by no stretch west is a very compassionate person he added and a lot of times he get in trouble trying to help others so i can identify with it its just that theres certain things that happened thats not really acceptable to me and we just need to speak about it but theres genuine love there 4 camila cabello vs fifth harmony getty images things turned messy between girl group fifth harmony and camila cabello pretty quickly after she announced she was leaving the group last december and the remaining members lauren jauregui ally brooke normani kordei and dinah jane claimed in a statement that they only learned of her departure through her representatives in an interview with billboard in february cabello talked about the intense split and admitted she hadnt spoken to her former bandmates i was always super open that i couldnt just sing other peoples words and be totally happy with that cabello said of exiting the group you have to follow and honor that inner voice i always encouraged the girls to do the same i dont want to get into the details of that because it was really intense and its hard for me to talk about she added about not keeping in touch it makes me sad in their own billboard interview in july fifth harmony wasnt shy about alluding to the bad blood lets just say were in a better place now there are no secrets in this circle jane said of cabellos exit however the shadiest moment definitely happened at the mtv video music awards in august when before their performance of angel and down a a fifth member of the group presumably meant to represent cabello fell backwards off the stage the group later denied they were slamming cabello during an interview with good morning america we get asked all the time if were getting a fifth member brooke explained and we wanted to show the world in an artistic way that hey the four of us are fifth harmony we are stronger and better than weve ever been 5 kim cattrall vs sex and the city cast new line cinema rumors have floated around for some time now that kim cattrall didnt get along with her sex and the city cast members and they were pretty much confirmed this year after sarah jessica parker announced that there would be no sex and the city 3 film its over were not doing it she told extra im disappointed we had this beautiful funny heartbreaking joyful very relatable script and story its not just disappointing that we dont get to tell the story and have that experience but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie the daily mail later reported that it was cattralls demands that put a stop to the project claiming she insisted that warner bros produce other movies she had in development before signing onto satc 3 cattrall denied the report on twitter cattrall then specifically called out parker during an interview with piers morgan for itvs life stories at this very moment its quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that ive been saying for almost a year she noted this is really where i take to task the people from sex and the city specifically sarah jessica parker in that i think she could have been nicer she expressed to morgan i really think she could have been nicer i dont know what her issue is i never have she added cattrall also said she was never friends with her satc costars including cynthia nixon and kristin davis weve been colleagues and in some ways its a very healthy place to be because then you have a clear line between your professional life and relationship and your personal she noted they all have children and i am 10 years older and since specifically the series ended i have been spending most of my time outside of new york so i dont see them the common ground that we had was the series and the series is over though she did admit that she wishes her costars would try harder to keep in touch after sharing that she couldnt even recall the last time she had spoken to them thats another thing thats really disappointing is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say how you doing she shared and it appears the cast is taking sides willie garson who portrayed stanford blatch the best friend of carrie bradshaw parker in both the tv series and the movies posted a cryptic tweet in october that appeared to be aimed at cattrall cattrall repeatedly denied that she ever considered doing a third satc movie and further claimed that she never began contract negotiations dear fans because im toxic im going to negotiate a contract for 6 months not come to terms then say i never wanted to do it anyway he wrote 6

politifact3428,1,social security online history pages supreme court case flemming vs nestor background to the case the fact that workers contribute to the social security programs funding through a dedicated payroll tax establishes a unique connection between those tax payments and future benefits more so than general federal income taxes can be said to establish rights to certain government services this is often expressed in the idea that social security benefits are an earned right this is true enough in a moral and political sense but like all federal entitlement programs congress can change the rules regarding eligibilityand it has done so many times over the years the rules can be made more generous or they can be made more restrictive benefits which are granted at one time can be withdrawn as for example with student benefits which were substantially scaledback in the 1983 amendments there has been a temptation throughout the programs history for some people to suppose that their fica payroll taxes entitle them to a benefit in a legal contractual sense that is to say if a person makes fica contributions over a number of years congress cannot according to this reasoning change the rules in such a way that deprives a contributor of a promised future benefit under this reasoning benefits under social security could probably only be increased never decreased if the act could be amended at all congress clearly had no such limitation in mind when crafting the law section 1104 of the 1935 act entitled reservation of power specifically said the right to alter amend or repeal any provision of this act is hereby reserved to the congress even so some have thought that this reservation was in some way unconstitutional this is the issue finally settled by flemming v nestor in this 1960 supreme court decision nestors denial of benefits was upheld even though he had contributed to the program for 19 years and was already receiving benefits under a 1954 law social security benefits were denied to persons deported for among other things having been a member of the communist party accordingly mr nestors benefits were terminated he appealed the termination arguing among other claims that promised social security benefits were a contract and that congress could not renege on that contract in its ruling the court rejected this argument and established the principle that entitlement to social security benefits is not contractual right flemming v nestor case name flemming v nestor 363 us 603 no 54 argued february 24 1960 decided june 20 1960 169 f supp 922 reversed the termination of oldage benefits payable to an alien who after the date of its enactment september 1 1954 is deported under sec 241a of the immigration and nationality act on any one of certain grounds specified in sec 202n appellee an alien who had become eligible for oldage benefits in 1955 was deported in 1956 pursuant to sec 241a of the immigration and nationality act for having been a member of the communist party from 1933 to 1939 since this was one of the grounds specified in sec 202n his oldage benefits were terminated shortly thereafter he commenced this action in a single judge district court under sec 205g of the social security act to secure judicial review of that administrative decision the district court held that sec 202n deprived appellee of an accrued property right and therefore violated the due process clause of the fifth amendment held 1 although this action drew into question the constitutionality of sec 202n it did not involve an injunction or otherwise interdict the operation of the statutory scheme 28 usc sec 2282 forbidding the issuance of an injunction restraining the enforcement operation or execution of an act of congress for repugnance to the constitution except by a threejudge district court was not applicable and jurisdiction over the action was properly exercised by the singlejudge district court pp 606608 2 a person covered by the social security act has not such a right in oldage benefit payments as would make every defeasance of accrued interests violative of the due process clause of the fifth amendment pp 608611 a the noncontractual interest of an employee covered by the act cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity whose rights to benefits are based on his contractual premium

v nestor appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia mr justice harlan delivered the opinon of the court from a decision of the district court for the district of columbia holding sec 202n of the social security act 68 stat 1083 as amended 42 usc sec 402n unconstitutional the secretary of health education and welfare takes this direct appeal pursuant to 28 usc sec 1252 the challenged section set forth in full in the margin fn1 provides for the termination of oldage survivor and disability insurance benefits payable to or in certain cases in respect of an alien individual who after september 1 1954 the date of enactment of the section is deported under sec 241a of the immigration and nationality act 8 usc sec 1251a on any one of certain grounds specified in sec 202n appellee an alien immigrated to this country from bulgaria in 1913 and became eligible for oldage benefits in november 1955 in july 1956 he was deported pursuant to sec 241a6ci of the immigration and nationality act for having been a member of the communist party from 1933 to 1939 this being one of the benefit termination deportation grounds specified in sec 202n appellees benefits were terminated soon thereafter and notice of the termination was given to his wife who had remained in this country fn2 upon his failure to obtain administrative reversal of the decision appellee commenced this action in the district court pursuant to sec 205g of the social security act 53 stat 1370 as amended 42 usc sec 405g to secure judicial review fn3 on crossmotions for summary judgment the district court ruled for appellee holding sec 202n unconstitutional under the due process clause of the fifth amendment in that it deprived appellee of an accrued property right 169 f supp 922 the secretary prosecuted an appeal to this court and subject to a jurisdictional question hereinafter discussed we set the case down for plenary hearing 360 us 915 the preliminary jurisdictional question is whether 28 usc sec 2282 is applicable and therefore required that the case be heard below before three judges rather than by a single judge as it was section 2282 forbids the issuance except by a threejudge district court of any interlocutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforcement operation or execution of any act of congress for repugnance to the constitution neither party requested a threejudge court below and in this court both parties argue the inapplicability of sec 2282 if the provision applies we cannot reach the merits but must vacate the judgment below and remand the case for consideration by a threejudge district court see federal housing administration v the darlington inc 352 us 977 under the decisions of this court this sec 205g action could and did draw in question the constitutionality of sec 202n see eg anniston mfg co v davis 301 us 337 345346 however the action did no more it did not seek affirmatively to interdict the operation of a statutory scheme a judgment for the appellee would not put the operation of a federal statute under the restraint of an equity decree indeed apart from its effect under the doctrine of stare decisis it would have no other result than to require the payment of appellees benefits in these circumstances we think that what was said in garment workers v donnelly co 304 us 243 where this court dealt with an analogous situation is controlling here the predecessor of sec 2282 does not provide for a case where the validity of an act of congress is merely drawn in question albeit that question be decided but only for a case where there is an application for an interlocutory or permanent injunction to restrain the enforcement of an act of congress had congress intended the provision for three judges and direct appeal to apply whenever a question of the validity of an act of congress became involved congress would naturally have used the familiar phrase drawn in question id at 250 we hold that jurisdiction over the action was properly exercised by the district court and therefore reach the merits i we think that the district court erred in holding that sec 202n deprived appellee of an accrued property right 169 f supp at 934 appellees right to social security benefits cannot properly be considered to have been of that order the general purposes underlying the social security act were expounded by mr justice cardozo in helvering v davis 301 us 619 640645 the issue here however requires some inquiry into the statutory scheme by which those purposes are sought to be achieved payments under the act are based upon the wage earners record of earnings in employment or selfemployment covered by the act and take the form of oldage insurance and disability insurance benefits inuring to the wage earner known as the primary beneficiary and of benefits including survivor benefits payable to named dependents secondary beneficiaries of a wage earner broadly speaking eligibility for benefits depends on satisfying statutory conditions as to 1 employment in covered employment or selfemployment see sec 210a 42 usc sec 410a 2 the requisite number of quarters of coverage ie threemonth periods during which not less than a stated sum was earned the number depending generally on age see secs 213215 42 usc secs 413415 and 3 attainment of the retirement age see sec 216a 42 usc sec 416a sec 202a 42 usc sec 402a fn4 entitlement to benefits once gained is partially or totally lost if the beneficiary earns more than a stated annual sum unless he or she is at least 72 years old sec 203b e 42 usc sec 403b e of special importance in this case is the fact that eligibility for benefits and the amount of such benefits do not in any true sense depend on contribution to the program through the payment of taxes but rather on the earnings record of the primary beneficiary the program is financed through a payroll tax levied on employees in covered employment and on their employers the tax rate which is a fixed percentage of the first 4800 of employee annual income is set at a scale which will increase from year to year presumably to keep pace with rising benefit costs irc of 1954 secs 3101 3111 3121a the tax proceeds are paid into the treasury as internal revenue collections irc sec 3501 and each year an amount equal to the proceeds is appropriated to a trust fund from which benefits and the expenses of the program are paid sec 201 42 usc sec 401 it was evidently contemplated that receipts would greatly exceed disbursements in the early years of operation of the system and surplus funds are invested in government obligations and the income returned to the trust fund thus provision is made for expected increasing costs of the program the social security system may be accurately described as a form of social insurance enacted pursuant to congress power to spend money in aid of the general welfare helvering v davis supra at 640 whereby persons gainfully employed and those who employ them are taxed to permit the payment of benefits to the retired and disabled and their dependents plainly the expectation is that many members of the present productive work force will in turn become beneficiaries rather than supporters of the program but each workers benefits though flowing from the contributions he made to the national economy while actively employed are not dependent on the degree to which he was called upon to support the system by taxation it is apparent that the noncontractual interest of an employee covered by the act cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity whose right to benefits is bottomed on his contractual premium payments it is hardly profitable to engage in conceptualizations regarding earned rights and gratuities cf lynch v united states 292 us 571 576577 the right to social security benefits is in one sense earned for the entire scheme rests on the legislative judgment that those who in their productive years were functioning members of the economy may justly call upon that economy in their later years for protection from the rigors of the poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journeys end is near helvering v davis supra at 641 but the practical effectuation of that judgment has of necessity called forth a highly complex and interrelated statutory structure integrated treatment of the manifold specific problems presented by the social security program demands more than a generalization that program was designed to function into the indefinite future and its specific provisions rest on predictions as to expected economic conditions which must inevitably prove less than wholly accurate and on judgments and preferences as to the proper allocation of the nations resources which evolving economic and social conditions will of necessity in some degree modify to engraft upon the social security system a concept of accrued property rights would deprive it of the flexibility and boldness in adjustment to everchanging conditions which it demands see wollenberg vested rights in socialsecurity benefits 37 ore l rev 299 359 it was doubtless out of an awareness of the need for such flexibility that congress included in the original act and has since retained a clause expressly reserving to it the right to alter amend or repeal any provision of the act sec 1104 49 stat 648 42 usc sec 1304 that provision makes express what is implicit in the institutional needs of the program see analysis of the social security system hearings before a subcommittee of the committee on ways and means house of representatives 83d cong 1st sess pp 920 921 it was pursuant to that provision that sec 202n was enacted we must conclude that a person covered by the act has not such a right in benefit payments as would make every defeasance of accrued interests violative of the due process clause of the fifth amendment ii this is not to say however that congress may exercise its power to modify the statutory scheme free of all constitutional restraint the interest of a covered employee under the act is of sufficient substance to fall within the protection from arbitrary governmental action afforded by the due process clause in judging the permissibility of the cutoff provisions of sec 202n from this standpoint it is not within our authority to determine whether the congressional judgment expressed in that section is sound or equitable or whether it comports well or ill with the purposes of the act whether wisdom or unwisdom resides in the scheme of benefits set forth in title ii it is not for us to say the answer to such inquiries must come from congress not the courts our concern here as often is with power not with wisdom helvering v davis supra at 644 particularly when we deal with a withholding of a noncontractual benefit under a social welfare program such as this we must recognize that the due process clause can be thought to interpose a bar only if the statute manifests a patently arbitrary classification utterly lacking in rational justification such is not the case here the fact of a beneficiarys residence abroad in the case of a deportee a presumably permanent residence can be of obvious relevance to the question of eligibility one benefit which may be thought to accrue to the economy from the social security system is the increased overall national purchasing power resulting from taxation of productive elements of the economy to provide payments to the retired and disabled who might otherwise be destitute or nearly so and who would generally spend a comparatively large percentage of their benefit payments this advantage would be lost as to payments made to one residing abroad for these purposes it is of course constitutionally irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision as it is irrelevant that the in logic apply fn5 see united states v petrillo 332 us 1 89 steward machine co v davis 301 us 548 584585 cf carmichael v southern coal co 301 us 495 510513 nor apart from this can it be deemed irrational for congress to have concluded that the public purse should not be utilized to contribute to the support of those deported on the grounds specified in the statute we need go no further to find support for our conclusion that this provision of the act cannot be condemned as so lacking in rational justification as to offend due process iii the remaining and most insistently pressed constitutional objections rest upon art i sec 9 cl 3 and art iii sec 2 cl 3 of the constitution and the sixth amendment fn6 it is said that the termination of appellees benefits amounts to punishing him without a judicial trial see wong wing v united states 163 us 228 that the termination of benefits constitutes the imposition of punishment by legislative act rendering sec 202n a bill of attainder see united states v lovett 328 us 303 cummings v missouri 4 wall 277 and that the punishment exacted is imposed for past conduct not unlawful when engaged in thereby violating the constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws see ex parte garland 4 wall 333 fn7 essential to the success of each of these contentions is the validity of characterizing as punishment in the constitutional sense the termination of benefits under sec 202n in determining whether legislation which bases a disqualification on the happening of a certain past event imposes a punishment the court has sought to discern the objects on which the enactment in question was focused where the source of legislative concern can be thought to be the activity or status from which the individual is barred the disqualification is not punishment even though it may bear harshly upon one affected the contrary is the case where the statute in question is evidently aimed at the person or class of persons disqualified in the earliest case on which appellee relies a clergyman successfully challenged a state constitutional provision barring from that profession and from many other professions and offices all who would not swear that they had never manifested any sympathy or support for the cause of the confederacy cummings v missouri supra the court thus described the aims of the challenged enactment the oath could not have been required as a means of ascertaining whether parties were qualified or not for their respective callings or the trusts with which they were charged it was required in order to reach the person not the calling it was exacted not from any notion that the several acts designated indicated unfitness for the callings but because it was thought that the several acts deserved punishment id at 320 only the other day the governing inquiry was stated in an opinion joined by four members of the court in these terms the question in each case where unpleasant consequences are brought to bear upon an individual for prior conduct is whether the legislative aim was to punish that individual for past activity or whether the restriction of the individual comes about as a relevant incident to a regulation of a present situation such as the proper qualifications for a profession de veau v braisted 363 us 144 160 plurality opinion in ex parte garland supra where the court struck down an oath similar in content to that involved in cummings required of attorneys seeking to practice before any federal court as also in cummings the finding of punitive intent drew heavily on the courts firsthand acquaintance with the events and the mood of the then recent civil war and the fierce passions which that struggle aroused cummings v missouri supra at 322 fn8 similarly in united states v lovett supra where the court invalidated as a bill of attainder a statute forbidding subject to certain conditions the further payment of the salaries of three named government employees the determination that a punishment had been imposed rested in large measure on the specific congressional history which the court was at pains to spell out in detail see 328 us at 308312 most recently in trop v dulles 356 us 86 which held unconstitutional a statute providing for the expatriation of one who had been sentenced by a courtmartial to dismissal or dishonorable discharge for wartime desertion the majority of the court characterized the statute as punitive however no single opinion commanded the support of a majority the plurality opinion rested its determination at least in part on its inability to discern any alternative purpose which the statute could be thought to serve id at 97 the concurring opinion found in the specific historical evolution of the provision in question compelling evidence of punitive intent id at 107109 it is thus apparent that though the governing criterion may be readily stated each case has turned on its own highly particularized context where no persuasive showing of a purpose to reach the person not the calling cummings v missouri supra at 320 has been made the court has not hampered legislative regulation of activities within its sphere of concern despite the oftensevere effects such regulation has had on the persons subject to it fn9 thus deportation has been held to be not punishment but an exercise of the plenary power of congress to fix the conditions under which aliens are to be permitted to enter and remain in this country fong yue ting v united states 149 us 698 730 see galvan v press 347 us 522 530531 similarly the setting by a state of qualifications for the practice of medicine and their modification from time to time is an incident of the states power to protect the health and safety of its citizens and its decision to bar from practice persons who commit or have committed a felony is taken as evidencing an intent to exercise that regulatory power and not a purpose to add to the punishment of ex felons hawker v new york 170 us 189 see de veau v braisted supra regulation of crime on the waterfront through disqualification of exfelons from holding union office cf helvering v mitchell 303 us 391 397401 holding that with respect to deficiencies due to fraud a 50 percent addition to the tax imposed was not punishment so as to prevent upon principles of double jeopardy its assessment against one acquitted of tax evasion turning then to the particular statutory provision before us appellee cannot successfully contend that the language and structure of sec 202n or the nature of the deprivation requires us to recognize a punitive design cf wong wing v united states supra imprisonment at hard labor up to one year of person found to be unlawfully in the country here the sanction is the mere denial of a noncontractual governmental benefit no affirmative disability or restraint is imposed and certainly nothing approaching the infamous punishment of imprisonment as in wong wing on which great reliance is mistakenly placed moreover for reasons already given ante pp 611612 it cannot be said as was said of the statute in cummings v missouri supra at 319 see dent v west virginia 129 us 114 126 that the disqualification of certain deportees from receipt of social security benefits while they are not lawfully in this country bears no rational connection to the purposes of the legislation of which it is a part and must without more therefore be taken as evidencing a congressional desire to punish appellee argues however that the history and scope of sec 202n prove that no such postulated purpose can be thought to have motivated the legislature and that they persuasively show that a punitive purpose in fact lay behind the statute we do not agree we observe initially that only the clearest proof could suffice to establish the unconstitutionality of a statute on such a ground judicial inquiries into congressional motives are at best a hazardous matter and when that inquiry seeks to go behind objective manifestations it becomes a dubious affair indeed moreover the presumption of constitutionality with which this enactment like any other comes to us forbids us lightly to choose that reading of the statutes setting which will invalidate it over that which will save it it is not on slight implication and vague conjecture that the legislature is to be pronounced to have transcended its powers and its acts to be considered as void fletcher v peck 6 cranch 87 128 of the social security program the provision originated in the house of representatives hr 9366 83d cong 2d sess sec 108 the discussion in the house committee report hr rep no 1698 83d cong 2d sess pp 5 25 77 does not express the purpose of the statute however it does say that the termination of benefits would apply to those persons who were deported from the united states because of illegal entry conviction of a crime or subversive activity id at 25 it was evidently the thought that such was the scope of the statute resulting from its application to deportation under the 14 named paragraphs of sec 241a of the immigration and nationality act id at 77 fn10 the senate committee rejected the proposal for the stated reason that it had not had an opportunity to give sufficient study to all the possible implications of this provision which involves termination of benefit rights under the contributory program of oldage and survivors insurance s rep no 1987 83d cong 2d sess p 23 see also id at 76 however in conference the proposal was restored in modified form fn11 and as modified was enacted as sec 202n see hr conf rep no 2679 83d cong 2d sess p 18 appellee argues that this history demonstrates that congress was not concerned with the fact of a beneficiarys deportation which it is claimed alone would justify this legislation as being pursuant to a policy relevant to regulation of the social security system but that it sought to reach certain grounds for deportation thus evidencing a punitive intent fn12 it is impossible to find in the meagre history the unmistakable evidence of punitive intent which under principles already discussed is required before a congressional enactment of this kind may be struck down even were that history to be taken as evidencing congress concern with the grounds rather than the fact of deportation we do not think that this standing alone would suffice to establish a punitive purpose this would still be a far cry from the situations involved in such cases as cummings wong wing and garland see ante p 617 and from that in lovett supra where the legislation was on its face aimed at particular individuals the legislative record however falls short of any persuasive showing that congress was in fact concerned alone with the grounds of deportation to be sure congress did not apply the termination provision to all deportees however it is evident that neither did it rest the operation of the statute on the occurrence of the underlying act the fact of deportation itself remained an essential condition for loss of benefits and even if a beneficiary were saved from deportation only through discretionary suspension by the attorney general under sec 244 of the immigration and nationality act 66 stat 214 8 usc sec 1254 sec 202n would not reach him moreover the grounds for deportation referred to in the committee report embrace the great majority of those deported as is evident from an examination of the four omitted grounds summarized in the margin fn13 inferences drawn from the omission of those grounds cannot establish to the degree of certainty required that congressional concern was wholly with the acts leading to deportation and not with the fact of deportation fn14 to hold otherwise would be to rest on the slight implication and vague conjecture against which chief justice marshall warned fletcher v peck supra at 128 the same answer must be made to arguments drawn from the failure of congress to apply sec 202n to beneficiaries voluntarily residing abroad but cf sec 202t ante note 5 congress may have failed to consider such persons or it may have thought their number too slight or the permanence of their voluntary residence abroad too uncertain to warrant application of the statute to them with its attendant administrative problems of supervision and enforcement again we cannot with confidence reject all those alternatives which imaginativeness can bring to mind save that one which might require the invalidation of the statute reversed footnotes footnote 1 section 202n provides as follows n1 if any individual is after the date of enactment of this subsection deported under paragraph 1 2 4 5 6 7 10 11 12 14 15 16 17 or 18 of section 241a of the immigration and nationality act then

on appellees deportation is not open to him footnote 8 see also pierce v carskadon 16 wall 234 a west virginia statute providing that a nonresident who had suffered a judgment in an action commenced

paragraphs are concerned with convictions of designated crimes or the commission of acts related to them such as narcotics addiction or prostitution footnote 11 for example under the house version termination of benefits of a deportee would also have terminated benefits paid to secondary beneficiaries based on the earning records of the deportee the conference proposal limited this effect to secondary beneficiaries who were nonresident aliens see note 2 ante footnote 12 appellee also relies on the juxtaposition of the proposed sec 108 and certain other provisions some of which were enacted and some of which were not this argument is too conjectural to warrant discussion in addition reliance is placed on a letter written to the senate finance committee by appellants predecessor in office opposing the enactment of what is now sec 202u of the act 70 stat 838 42 usc sec 402u on the ground that the section was in the nature of a penalty and based on considerations foreign to the objectives of the program social security amendments of 1955 hearings before the senate committee on finance 84th cong 2d sess p 1319 the secretary went on to say that present law recognizes only three narrowly limited exceptions of which sec 202n is one to the basic principle that benefits are paid without regard to the attitudes opinions behavior or personal characteristics of the individual it should be observed however that the secretary did not speak of sec 202n as a penalty as he did of the proposed sec 202u the latter provision is concededly penal and applies only pursuant to a judgment of a court in a criminal case footnote 13 they are 1 persons institutionalized at public expense within five years after entry because of mental disease defect or deficiency not shown to have

within five years after entry any other alien to enter or attempt to enter unlawfully sec 241a13 footnote 14 were we to engage in speculation it would not be difficult to conjecture that congress may have been led to exclude these four grounds of deportation out of compassionate or de minimis considerations mr justice black dissenting for the reasons stated here and in the dissents of mr justice douglas and mr justice brennan i agree with the district court that the united states is depriving appellee ephram nestor of his statutory right to oldage benefits in violation of the united states constitution nestor came to this country from bulgaria in 1913 and lived here continuously for 43 years until july 1956 he was then deported from this country for having been a communist from 1933 to 1939 at that time membership in the communist party as such was not illegal and was not even a statutory ground for deportation from december 1936 to january 1955 nestor and his employers made regular payments to the government under the federal insurance contributions act 26 usc secs 31013125 these funds went to a special federal oldage and survivors insurance trust fund under 49 stat 622 53 stat 1362 as amended 42 usc sec 401 in return for which nestor like millions of others expected to receive payments when he reached the statutory age in 1954 15 years after nestor had last been a communist and 18 years after he began to make payments into the oldage security fund congress passed a law providing among other things that any person who had been deported from this country because of past communist membership under 66 stat 205 8 usc sec 1251a6c should be wholly cut off from any benefits of the fund to which he had contributed under the law 68 stat 1083 42 usc sec 402n after the government deported nestor in 1956 it notified his wife who had remained in this country that he was cut off and no further payments would be made to him this action it seems to me takes nestors insurance without just compensation and in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment moreover it imposes an ex post facto law and bill of attainder by stamping him without a court trial as unworthy to receive that for which he has paid and which the government promised to pay him the fact that the court is sustaining this action indicates the extent to which people are willing to go these days to overlook violations of the constitution perpetrated against anyone who has ever even innocently belonged to the communist party i in lynch v united states 292 us 571 this court unanimously held that congress was without power to repudiate and abrogate in whole or in part its promises to pay amounts claimed by soldiers under the war risk insurance act of 1917 secs 400405 40 stat 409 this court held that such a repudiation was inconsistent with the provision of the fifth amendment that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation the court today puts the lynch case aside on the ground that it is hardly profitable to engage in conceptualizations regarding earned rights and gratuities from this sound premise the court goes on to say that while the right to social security benefits is in one sense earned yet the governments insurance scheme now before us rests not on the idea of the contributors to the fund earning something but simply provides that they may justly call upon the government in their later years for protection from the rigors of the poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journeys end is near these are nice words but they cannot conceal the fact that they simply tell the contributors to this insurance fund that despite their own and their employers payments the government in paying the beneficiaries out of the fund is merely giving them something for nothing and can stop doing so when it pleases this in my judgment reveals a complete misunderstanding of the purpose congress and the country had in passing that law it was then generally agreed as it is today that it is not desirable that aged people think of the government as giving them something for nothing an excellent statement of this view quoted by mr justice douglas in another connection was made by senator george the chairman of the finance committee when the social security act was passed and one very familiar with the philosophy that brought it about it comports better than any substitute we have discovered with the american concept that free men want to earn their security and not ask for doles that what is due as a matter of earned right is far better than a gratuity social security is not a handout it is not charity it is not relief it is an earned right based upon the contributions and earnings of the individual as an earned right the individual is eligible to receive his benefit in dignity and selfrespect 102 cong rec 15110 the people covered by this act are now able to rely with complete assurance on the fact that they will be compelled to contribute regularly to this fund whenever each contribution falls due i believe they are entitled to rely with the same assurance on getting the benefits they have paid for and have been promised when their disability or age makes their insurance payable under the terms of the law the court did not permit the government to break its plighted faith with the soldiers in the lynch case it said the constitution forbade such governmental conduct i would say precisely the same thing here the court consoles those whose insurance is taken away today and others who may suffer the same fate in the future by saying that a decision requiring the social security system to keep faith would deprive it of the flexibility and boldness in adjustment to ever changing conditions which it demands people who pay premiums for insurance usually think they are paying for insurance not for flexibility and boldness i cannot believe that any private insurance company in america would be permitted to repudiate its matured contracts with its policyholders who have regularly paid all their premiums in reliance upon the good faith of the company it is true as the court says that the original act contained a clause still in force that expressly reserves to congress the right to alter amend or repeal any provision of the act sec 1104 49 stat 648 42 usc sec 1304 congress of course properly retained that power it could repeal the act so as to cease to operate its oldage insurance activities for the future this means that it could stop covering new people and even stop increasing its obligations to its old contributors but that is quite different from disappointing the just expectations of the contributors to the fund which the government has compelled them and their employers to pay its treasury there is nothing conceptualistic about saying as this court did in lynch that such a taking as this the constitution forbids ii in part ii of its opinion the court throws out a line of hope by its suggestion that if congress in the future cuts off some other group from the benefits they have bought from the government this court might possibly hold that the future hypothetical act violates the due process clause in doing so it reads due process as affording only minimal protection and under this reading it will protect all future groups from destruction of their rights only if congress manifests a patently arbitrary classification utterly lacking in rational justification the due process clause so defined provides little protection indeed compared with the specific safeguards of the constitution such as its prohibitions against taking private property for a public use without just compensation passing ex post facto laws and imposing bills of attainder i cannot agree however that the due process clause is properly interpreted when it is used to subordinate and dilute the specific safeguards of the bill of rights and when due process itself becomes so wholly dependent upon this courts idea of what is arbitrary and rational see levine v united states 362 us 610 620 dissenting opinion adamson v california 332 us 46 8992 dissenting opinion rochin v california 342 us 165 174 concurring opinion one reason for my belief in this respect is that i agree with what is said in the courts quotation from helvering v davis 301 us 619 644 whether wisdom or unwisdom resides in the scheme of benefits set forth in title ii it is not for us to say the answer to such inquiries must come from congress not the courts our concern here as often is with power not with wisdom and yet the courts assumption of its power to hold acts unconstitutional because the court thinks they are arbitrary and irrational can be neither more nor less than a judicial foray into the field of governmental policy by the use of this due process formula the court does not as its proponents frequently proclaim abstain from interfering with the congressional policy it actively enters that field with no standards except its own conclusion as to what is arbitrary and what is rational and this elastic formula gives the court a further power that of holding legislative acts constitutional on the ground that they are neither arbitrary nor irrational even though the acts violate specific bill of rights safeguards see my dissent in adamson v california supra whether this act had rational justification was in my judgment for congress whether it violates the federal constitutional is for us to determine unless we are by circumlocution to abdicate the power that this court has been held to have ever since marbury v madison 1 cranch 137 iii the court in part iii of its opinion holds that the 1954 act is not an ex post facto law or bill or attainder even though it creates a class of deportees who cannot collect their insurance benefits because they were once communists at a time when simply being a communist was not illegal the court also puts great emphasis on its belief that the act here is not punishment although not believing that the particular label punishment is of decisive importance i think the act does impose punishment even in a classic sense the basic reason for nestors loss of his insurance payments is that he was once a communist this man now 69 years old has been driven out of the country where he has lived for 43 years to a land where he is practically a stranger under an act authorizing his deportation many years after his communist membership cf galvan v press 347 us 522 532 533 dissenting opinions now a similar ex post facto law deprives him of his insurance which while petty and insignificant in amount to this great government may well be this exiles daily bread for the same reason and in accord with the general fashion of the day that is to punish in every way possible anyone who ever made the mistake of being a communist in this country or who is supposed ever to have been associated with anyone who made that mistake see eg barenblatt v united states 360 us 109 and uphaus v wyman 360 us 72 in united states v lovett 328 us 303 315316 we said legislative acts no matter what their form that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial are bills of attainder prohibited by the constitution faithful observance of our holdings in that case in ex parte garland 4 wall 333 and in cummings v missouri 4 wall 277 would in my judgment require us to hold that the 1954 act is a bill of attainder it is a congressional enactment aimed at an easily ascertainable group it is certainly punishment in any normal sense of the word to take away from any person the benefits of an insurance system into which he and his employer have paid their moneys for almost two decades and it does all this without a trial according to due process of law it is true that the lovett cummings and garland court opinions were not unanimous but they nonetheless represent positive precedents on highly important questions of individual liberty which should not be explained away with cobwebbery refinements if the court is going to overrule these cases in whole or in part and adopt the views of previous dissenters i believe it should be done clearly and forthrightly a basic constitutional infirmity of this act in my judgment is that it is a part of a pattern of laws all of which violate the first amendment out of fear that this country is in grave danger if it lets a handful of communist fanatics or some other extremist group make their arguments and discuss their ideas this fear i think is baseless it reflects a lack of faith in the sturdy patriotism of our people and does not give to the world a true picture of our abiding strength it is an unworthy fear in a country that has a bill of rights containing provisons for fair trials freedom of speech press and religion and other specific safeguards designed to keep men free i repeat once more that i think this nations greatest security lies not in trusting to a momentary majority of this courts view at any particular time of what is patently arbitrary but in wholehearted devotion to and observance of our constitutional freedoms see wieman v updegraff 344 us 183 192 concurring opinion i would affirm the judgment of the district court which held that nestor is constitutionally entitled to collect his insurance mr justice douglas dissenting appellee came to this country from bulgaria in 1913 and was employed so as to be covered by the social security act from december 1936 to january 1955 a period of 19 years he became eligible for retirement and for social security benefits in november 1955 and was awarded 5560 per month in july 1956 he was deported for having been a member of the communist party from 1933 to 1939 pursuant to a law enacted september 1 1954 he was thereupon denied payment of further social security benefits this 1954 law seems to me to be a classic example of a bill of attainder which art i sec 9 of the constitution prohibits congress from enacting a bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without a judicial trial cummings v missouri 4 wall 277 323 in the old days punishment was meted out to a creditor or rival or enemy by sending him to the gallows but as recently stated by irving brant fn1 by smiting a man day after day with slanderous words by taking away his opportunity to earn a living you can drain the blood from his veins without even scratching his skin todays bill of attainder is broader than the classic form and not so tall and sharp there is mental in place of physical torture and confiscation of tommorrows bread and butter instead of yesterdays land and gold what is perfectly clear is that hate fear and prejudice play the same role today in the destruction of human rights in america that they did in england when a frenzied mob of lords judges bishops and shoemakers turned the titus oates blacklist into a hangmans record hate jealousy and spite continue to fill the legislative attainder lists just as they did in the irish parliament of exking james bills of attainder when they imposed punishment less than death were bills of pains and penalties and equally beyond the constitutional power of congress cummings v missouri supra at 323 punishment in the sense of a bill of attainder includes the deprivation or suspension of political or civil rights cummings v missouri supra at 322 in that case it was barring a priest from practicing his profession in ex parte garland 4 wall 333 it was excluding a man from practicing law in the federal courts in united states v lovett 328 us 303 it was cutting off employees compensation and barring them permanently from government service cutting off a persons livelihood by denying him accrued social benefits part of his property interests is no less a punishment here as in the other cases cited the penalty exacted has one of the classic purposes of punishment fn2 to reprimand the wrongdoer to deter others trop v dulles 356 us 86 96 social security payments are not gratuities they are products of a contributory system the funds being raised by payment from employees and employers alike or in case of selfemployed persons by the individual alone see social security board v nierotko 327 us 358 364 the funds are placed in the federal oldage and survivors insurance trust fund 42 usc sec 401a and only those who contribute to the fund are entitled to its benefits the amount of benefits being related to the amount of contributions made see stark social security its importance to lawyers 43 abaj 319 321 1957 as the late senator george long chairman of the senate finance committee and one of the authors of the social security system said there has developed through the years a feeling both in and out of congress that the contributory social insurance principle fits our times that it serves a vital need that cannot be as well served otherwise it comports better than any substitute we have discovered with the american concept that free men want to earn their security and not ask for doles that what is due as a matter of earned right is far better than a gratuity social security is not a handout it is not charity it is not relief it is an earned right based upon the contributions and earnings of the individual as an earned right the individual is eligible to receive his benefit in dignity and selfrespect 102 cong rec 15110 social security benefits have rightly come to be regarded as basic financial protection against the hazards of old age and disability as stated in a recent house report the oldage and survivors insurance system is the basic program which provides protection for americas families against the loss of earned income upon the retirement or death of the family provider the program provides benefits related to earned income and such benefits are paid for by the contributions made with respect to persons working in covered occupations hr rep no 1189 84th cong 1st sess 2 congress could provide that only people resident here could get social security benefits yet both the house and the senate rejected any residence requirements see hr rep no 1698 83d cong 2d sess 2425 s rep no 1987 83d cong 2d sess 23 congress concededly might amend the program to meet new conditions but may it take away social security benefits from one person or from a group of persons for vindictive reasons could congress on deporting an alien for having been a communist confiscate his home appropriate his savings accounts and thus send him out of the country penniless i think not any such act would be a bill of attainder the difference as i see it between that case and this is one merely of degree social security benefits made up in part of this aliens own earnings are taken from him because he once was a communist the view that sec 202n with which we now deal imposes a penalty was taken by secretary folsom appellants predecessor when opposing enlargement of the category of people to be denied benefits of social security eg those convicted of treason and sedition he said because the deprivation of benefits as provided in the amendment is in the nature of a penalty and based on considerations foreign to the objectives and provisions of the oldage and survivors insurance program the amendment may well serve as a precedent for extension of similar provisions to other public programs and to other crimes which while perhaps different in degree are difficult to distinguish in principle the present law recognizes only three narrowly limited exceptions fn3 to the basic principle that benefits are paid without regard to the attitudes opinions behavior or personal characteristics of the individual hearings senate finance committee on social security amendments of 1955 84th cong 2d sess 1319 the committee reports though meagre support secretary folsom in that characterization of sec 202n the house report tersely stated that termination of the benefits would apply to those persons who were deported because of illegal entry conviction of a crime or subversive activity hr rep no 1698 83d cong 2d sess 25 the aim and purpose are clear to take away from a person by legislative fiat property which he has accumulated because he has acted in a certain way or embraced a certain ideology that is a modern version of the bill of attainder as plain as direct as effective as those which religious passions once loosed in england and which later were employed against the tories here fn4 i would affirm this judgment footnotes footnote 1 address entitled bills of attainder in 1787 and today columbia law review dinner 1954 published in 1959 by the emergency civil liberties committee under the title congressional investigations and bills of attainder footnote 2 the broad sweep of the idea of punishment behind the concept of the bill of attainder was stated as follows by irving brant op cit supra note 1 910 in 1794 the american people were in a state of excitement comparable to that which exists today supporters of the french revolution had organized the democratic societies blatantly adopting that subversive title then the whisky rebellion exploded in western pennsylvania the democratic societies were blamed a motion censuring the societies was introduced in the house of representatives there in 1794 you had the basic division in american thought on one side the doctrine of political liberty for everybody with collective security resting on the capacity of the people for self government on the other side the doctrine that the people could not be trusted and political liberty must be restrained james madison challenged this latter doctrine the investigative power of congress over persons he contended was limited to inquiry into the conduct of individuals in the public service opinions he said are not the subjects of legislation start criticizing people for abuse of their reserved rights and the censure might extend to freedom of speech and press what would be the effect on the people thus condemned said madison it is in vain to say that this indiscriminate censure is no punishment is not this proposition if voted a bill of attainder madison won his fight not because he called the resolution a bill of attainder but because it attainted too many men who were going to vote in the next election the definition however was there a bill of attainder and the definition was given by the foremost american authority on the principles of liberty and order underlying our system of government footnote 3 the three exceptions referred to were 1 sec 202n 2 act of september 1 1954 68 stat 1142 5 usc secs 22812288 3 regulation of the social security administration 20 cfr sec 403409 denying dependents benefits to a person found guilty of felonious homicide of the insured worker footnote 4 brant op cit supra note 1 states at p 9 what were the framers aiming at when they forbade bills of attainder they were of course guarding against the religious passions that disgraced christianity in europe but american bills of attainder just before 1787 were typically used by revolutionary assemblies to rid the states of british loyalists by a curious coincidence it was usually the tory with a good farm who was sent into exile and all too often it was somebody who wanted that farm who induced the legislature to attaint him patriotism could serve as a cloak for greed as easily as religion did in that irish parliament of james the second but consider a case in which nothing could be said against the motive during the revolution governor patrick henry induced the virginia legislature to pass a bill of attainder condemning josiah phillips to death he was a traitor a murderer a pirate and an outlaw when ratification of the new constitution came before the virginia convention henry inveighed against it because it contained no bill of rights edmund randolph taunted him with his sponsorship of the phillips bill of attainder henry then made the blunder of defending it the bill was warranted he said because phillips was no socrates that shocking defense of arbitrary condemnation may have produced the small margin by which the constitution was ratified mr justice brennan with whom the chief justice and mr justice douglas join dissenting when nestor quit the communist party in 1939 his past membership was not a ground for his deportation kessler v strecker 307 us 22 it was not until a year later that past membership was made a specific ground for deportation fn1 this past membership has cost nestor dear it brought him expulsion from the country after 43 years residence most of his life now more is exacted from him for after he had begun to receive benefits in 1955 having worked in covered employment the required time and reached age 65 and might anticipate receiving them the rest of his life the benefits were stopped pursuant to sec 202n of the amended social security act fn2 his predicament is very real an aging man deprived of the means with which to live after being separated from his family and exiled to live among strangers in a land he quit 47 years ago the common sense of it is that he has been punished severely for his past conduct even the 1950 statute deporting aliens for past membership raised serious questions in this court whether the prohibition against ex post facto laws was violated in galvan v press 347 us 522 531 we said since the intrinsic consequences of deportation are so close to punishment for crime it might fairly be said also that the ex post facto clause even though applicable only to punitive legislation should be applied to deportation however precedents which treat deportation not as punishment but as a permissible exercise of congressional power to enact the conditions under which aliens may come to and remain in this country governed the decision in favor of the constitutionality of the statute however the court cannot rest a decision that sec 202n does not impose punishment on congress power to regulate immigration it escapes the commonsense conclusion that congress has imposed punishment by finding the requisite rational nexus to a granted power in the supposed furtherance of the social security program enacted pursuant to congress power to spend money in aid of the general welfare i do not understand the court to deny that but for that connection sec 202n would impose punishment and not only offend the constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws but also violate the constitutional guarantees against imposition of punishment without a judicial trial the courts test of the constitutionality of sec 202n is whether the legislative concern underlying the statute was to regulate the activity or status from which the individual is barred or whether the statute is evidently aimed at the person or class of persons disqualified it rejects the inference that the statute is aimed at the person or class of persons disqualified by relying upon the presumption of constitutionality this presumption might be a basis for sustaining the statute if in fact there were two opposing inferences which could reasonably be drawn from the legislation one that it imposes punishment and the other that it is purposed to further the administration of the social security program the court however does not limit the presumption to that use rather the presumption becomes a complete substitute for any supportable finding of a rational connection of sec 202n with the social security program for me it is not enough to state the test and hold that the presumption alone satisfies it i find it necessary to examine the act and its consequences to ascertain whether there is ground for the inference of a congressional concern with the administration of the social security program only after this inquiry would i consider the application of the presumption the court seems to acknowledge that the statute bears harshly upon the individual disqualified but states that this is permissible when a statute is enacted as a regulation of the activity but surely the harshness of the consequences is itself a relevant consideration to the inquiry into the congressional purpose fn3 cf trop v dulles 356 us 86 110 concurring opinion it seems to me that the statute itself shows that the sole legislative concern was with the person or class of persons disqualified congress did not disqualify for benefits all beneficiaries residing abroad or even all dependents residing abroad who are aliens if that had been the case i might agree that congress concern would have been with the activity or status and not with the person or class of persons disqualified the scales would then be tipped toward the conclusion that congress desired to limit benefit payments to beneficiaries residing in the united states so that the american economy would be aided by expenditure of benefits here indeed a proposal along those lines was submitted to congress in 1954 at the same time sec 202n was proposed fn4 and it was rejected fn5 perhaps the courts conclusion that regulation of the activity or status was the congressional concern would be a fair appraisal of the statute if congress had terminated the benefits of all alien beneficiaries who are deported but that is not what congress did the 18 grounds for which aliens may be deported fn6 hr rep no 1698 83d cong 2d sess 25 77 cited by the court describes sec 202n as including persons who were deported because of unlawful entry conviction of a crime or subversive activity the acts as narcotic addiction or prostitution the common element of the 14 grounds is that the alien has been guilty of some blameworthy conduct in other words congress worked its will only on aliens deported for conduct displeasing to the lawmakers this is plainly demonstrated by the remaining four grounds of deportation those which do not result in the cancellation of benefits fn7 two of those four grounds cover persons who become public charges within five years after entry for reasons which predated the entry a third ground covers the alien who fails to maintain his nonimmigrant status the fourth ground reaches the alien who prior to or within five years after entry aids other aliens to enter the country illegally those who are deported for becoming public charges clearly have not by modern standards engaged in conduct worthy of censure the governments suggestion that the reason for their exclusion from sec 202n was an unarticulated feeling of congress that it would be unfair to the other country to deport such destitute persons without letting them retain their modicum of social security benefits appears at best fanciful especially since by hypothesis they are deportable because the conditions which led to their becoming public charges existed prior to entry the exclusion from the operation of sec 202n of aliens deported for failure to maintain nonimmigrant status rationally can be explained in the context of the whole statute only as evidencing that congress considered that conduct less blameworthy certainly the governments suggestion that congress may have thought it unlikely that such persons would work sufficient time in covered employment to become eligible for social security benefits cannot be the reason for this exclusion for frequently the very act which eventually results in the deportation of persons on that ground is the securing of private employment finally it is impossible to reconcile the continuation of benefits to aliens who are deported for aiding other aliens to enter the country illegally except upon the ground that congress felt that their conduct was less reprehensible again the governments suggestion that the reason might be congress belief that these aliens would not have worked in covered employment must be rejected five years after entry would be ample time within which to secure employment and qualify moreover the same fiveyear limitation applies to several of the 14 grounds of deportation for which aliens are cut off from benefits and the governments argument would apply equally to them if that in fact was the congressional reason this appraisal of the distinctions drawn by congress between various kinds of conduct impels the conclusion beyond peradventure that the distinctions can be understood only if the purpose of congress was to strike at the person or class of persons disqualified the court inveighs against invalidating a statute on implicaton and vague conjecture rather i think the court has strained to sustain the statute on implication and vague conjecture in holding that the congressional concern was the activity or status from which the individual is barred todays decision sanctions the use of the spending power not to further the legitimate objectives of the social security program but to inflict hurt upon those who by their conduct have incurred the displeasure of congress the framers ordained that even the worst of men should not be punished for their past acts or for any conduct without adherence to the procedural safeguards written into the constitution todays decision is to me a regretful retreat from lovett cummings and garland

to iraq 76 sens say they have by patrick fitzgerald at least 76 senators have visited iraq in the four years of combat including 38 who have made the trip in the last 12 months according to a survey by the hill but at least 18 senators have not traveled there at all as debate over the war reaches a tipping point in washington visiting iraq has become a rite of passage for many lawmakers looking to bolster their credibility on national security many lawmakers feel that making a trip is important for their credibility when they are asked to weigh in on the war have you been to iraq graham charged have you ever been and talked to them webb who has not made a trip to the country replied by disparaging the congressional delegations as dog and pony shows that do not confront the reality on the ground webbs views may well be the exception as many senators still make the visit topping the list is sen jack reed dri who has visited iraq 10 times that includes three trips in the past year and makes him one of nine senators who have made at least a halfdozen trips to the country since the war started on the other side of the aisle neither george voinovich ohio nor pete domenici nm two senate republicans who recently made headlines by breaking with the bush administration and calling for a new direction in iraq has visited the country but similarly critical republicans john warner va olympia snowe maine and gordon smith ore have all made the trip more than once james thurber professor of political science and director of the center for congressional and presidential studies at american university said that iraq visits give lawmakers more credibility on the war the more trips you go give you more authority thurber said but seeing the situation and speaking with the troops on the ground can reinforce preexisting notions about the war thurber said he added that some senators have already made up their minds about whats going on before making a trip indeed many of the more outspoken lawmakers on both sides of the iraq debate are among the most traveled and few have changed their minds after returning besides reed war critics such as sens carl levin dmich joseph biden ddel chuck hagel rneb and john kerry dmass have all made multiple trips levin tops that group with eight visits sen james inhofe rokla an ardent defender of the war effort has gone to iraq eight times

are republicans three are democrats and one lieberman is an independent who caucuses with democrats the common thread linking senators with the highest trip totals appears to be membership on either

politifact1251,1,rockefeller an opportunity we cant pass up rockefeller an opportunity we cant pass up earlier this month the president outlined a clear vision for health care reform a plan that will put families ahead of corporate profits reduce skyrocketing health care costs and provide a strong pathway for more americans to access meaningful and affordable care with congress back in session and back to work on health care reform we must continue to build on the presidents vision and capitalize on this profound opportunity to fix a broken system and make life better for millions of americans today it is an undeniable fact that millions of families carry the burden of failed health care policies and unmet promises too many feel as if they are walking a tightrope just one serious illness threatens to throw them off balance and send them tumbling down real protection for the american people means health coverage must be accountable the insurance that you buy today must be there when you need it tomorrow too many families who have paid their premiums faithfully every month for years expecting to be covered suddenly find themselves stuck with devastatingly high bills when they get sick their plans dont actually provide coverage when they need it it makes you wonder what the purpose of that health insurance is in the first place if it offers no protection against the ruin that they hoped to avoid as chairman of the senate finance subcommittee on health care i believe we must continue to make tougher insurance regulation and greater transparency a top priority and i will fight to protect families and businesses across the nation the finance committee has laid out its framework but at this point it simply does not go far enough to protect americans from devastating insurance practices or outright loss of coverage many americans 46 percent get their health coverage through large employers in the selfinsured market any new insurance market reforms such as a prohibition on rescissions and benefit caps should apply to this market as well otherwise we will be doing very little to improve the coverage of a significant number of americans in west virginia the example of a local garment company corbin limited is a sad reminder of the selfinsured markets risks when corbin declared bankruptcy in april 2003 444 former employees were left with 2 million in medical bills with a selffunded plan corbin was subject only to the department of labors inadequate regulation and had no licensing requirements or solvency standards when the company went under its employees had no means of appeal comprehensive health insurance reforms like prohibiting rescissions eliminating preexisting condition exclusions and protecting employees in case of bankruptcy must apply to all insurers and policies in every single market including the selfinsured in the senate commerce science and transportation committee we recently heard testimony by wendell potter who worked in the insurance industry for more than 20 years he explained very clearly the tactics insurance companies use to keep policyholders in the dark he said they deceive consumers with incomprehensible explanations of their benefits often leading people to simply ignore them or throw them away he also said that more and more consumers are falling victim to deceptive marketing practices which essentially encourage them to buy policies with high costs and limited benefits consumers cant make real choices because the insurance industry doesnt use standard terms or definitions and consumers cant challenge insurance companies decisions because the companies dont explain the terms of coverage in clear understandable language when insurance companies fail to meet their obligations to these people it literally becomes a matter of life and death thats why since march ive been holding a series of hearings in the commerce panel to get to the bottom of these misleading practices and demanding explanations from companies like cigna and its why i wholeheartedly believe that holding insurance companies including selfinsured plans accountable for their actions has to be at the heart of any true health care reform insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001 while premiums for consumers have doubled right now the insurance industry is profitdriven when it should be patientdriven theyre unfairly raising prices cutting people out of coverage for preexisting conditions and as one report i released through the committee revealed systematically overcharging consumers who choose to see doctors outside of their networks to fight back i have introduced the consumers health care act in addition to creating a strong public insurance option that would put competitive pressure on insurance companies and help drive down costs my legislation also creates americas health insurance trust created for consumers and run by consumers the presidents speech marked the first time the public option has been clearly explained to the american people he reopened the door to a serious discussion about a public insurance option and the time to have that discussion is now our goal is comprehensive reform and that takes work long hours some disagreement a lot of coming together and a deep commitment to bringing families real solutions once and for all i share the presidents confidence and resolve that we will succeed sen jay rockefeller dwva is chairman of the senate commerce science and transportation committee and the senate finance subcommittee on health care

gossipcop-854098,1,scandal season 6 finale postmortem bellamy young on luna cyrus twists warning the following story contains spoilers about thursdays season 6 finale of scandal read at your own risk mellie grant bellamy young is officially the new president of the united states but shes not the most powerful person in the world scandal wrapped up season 6 thursday with one twist after another in the twohour closer no mama pope khandi alexander did not assassinate mellie on inauguration day 1 because rowan joe morton shoots her in the shoulder before she could pull the trigger and 2 because she was actually going to kill vp luna tessie santiago why olivia kerry washington figures out that luna was the one who orchestrated the assassination on frankie vargas yup her own husband because she didnt want to be stuck as first lady and believed that she as a sympathetic widow would be able to accomplish more than frankie ever couldve in office luna thinks she has a trump card telling liv that like jackie kennedy shes untouchable and mellie needs her to carry out her agenda but liv just needs a couple hours to gladiate with jakes scott foley help because theyve both killed vps lol she pressures luna into taking pills that would simulate a heart attack and thus kill her that way her legacy will still be intact and no one will ever know she had her own hubby killed abcs 201718 fall lineup everything you need to know step 2 of livs plan involved her tricking mellie into signing an executive order that would fund the reinstatement of b613 which rowan had pushed fitz tony goldwyn to do as his last act as potus fitz for once made a good decision for himself nixed the order and headed off to vermont but not before a hotandheavy makeout sesh with liv on the white house lawn now with mellies signature b613 is back and liv informs rowan that she is going to run it but wait thats not all during a nightcap with cyrus jeff perry liv realizes this whole thing was actually cyrus doing after he repeats the same language luna used about jackie kennedy and such this was definitely no slip of the tongue cyrus is too cunning for that this also explains why cyrus turned down mellies offer to be vp paving the way for luna to be on the ticket color liv impressed and she offers him vp how does it feel to be the most powerful person in the world cyrus asks it feels right the white and now black hatwearer replies but the new leader of the free world is still oblivious to all of this how would mellie react if and when she finds out we caught up with bellamy young to discuss all those twists what shed like to see in the final season and why quinns katie lowes big news shes pregnant with charlies george newbern child lowes is pregnant irl was her favorite part of the finale what was your first reaction to the luna twist and then the cyrus twist bellamy young oh my god i never see anything coming i watch and read like a fan im never one step ahead of anything so the luna twist really knocked me she had been written up to that point with such loyalty and such girl power and mutual support so it was really a gut punch and tessie plays her so well with so much heart and so much emotion it was a real twist of the knife for her to turn like that but i think a brilliant story point with cyrus gosh i mean mellie has no idea about any of this i can only react as a fan and say that never never underestimate cyrus no one does washington better than cyrus and he will triumph by whatever means necessary and dont ever fool yourself into thinking hes out of the game he purposely outed himself theres no way that was an accident young oh for sure its like a sociopath who leaves clues for the detective whos tracking him when you are that good at what you do whether its for good or evil you want people to appreciate your work so i think in that moment he definitely wants olivia to be aware of what hes done and if not respect him be in awe of his power and to never forget who he is as a person she totally does she still wants him to be vp young yeah its getting so interesting next year because olivia is at such a moral crossroads she has all power power for good in the white house and dark power with b613 i think were really going to have a season of olivia finding out who she is and watching her wrestle with that true deep existential morality our show has always been about what power does to you and whom you can trust and how to stay yourself or not but to watch it all unfold internally in her and how the rest of us will get caught up in a storm of her gravitational pull is going to be very interesting i think it was very wise of cyrus he sees all and it was very wise of him to see that moment in her and for him to remind her exactly who he is bellamy young scandal richard cartwright abc mellie is in the dark about everything right now how do you think shes going to react to first lunas death young i have no way of knowing anything but i can only imagine that mellie will be absolutely shocked about luna its been such a terrifying ordeal to go through an assassination attempt and to have a target on your back and i think the human instinct is to want answers so when someone gives you a plausible one you cling to it and if it comes from olivia mellie still believes in olivia she still believes if you had a hard question olivia doesnt have the easy answer but the right answer when mellie loses herself a little bit its olivia she turns to to remind herself who she is so if olivia tells her that luna was at the bottom of this plot to assassinate her behind peus behind mama pope behind everyone i think mellie will be too willing to believe it and it will leave her jaw open for the sucker punch which is cyrus do you think olivia will tell mellie everything including how she used her to fund b613 young i dont know i have no way of knowing what our writers will do its our last season so they could do anything i dont know at this point i feel terrible joyce laughs i dont know what to say i think you can answer this luna said she didnt want to feel trapped as first lady which was something mellie struggled with feeling ornamental do you think mellie wouldve sympathized with her had she found out about the scheme before luna died young certainly certainly i think in the quiet private moments she and luna had so much in common similarly to the talk she had with jakes wife vanessa when she said use your power make your life realize your opportunities and seize them i think a luna and mellie conversation wouldve been along those lines but again thats very nave because all along luna was pulling the strings puppeting everyone so mellie couldve never had seen that but its nice too to see an alternate reality of what mellie couldve been shes always wanted more but shes always wanted it in an aboveboard way shes a pragmatist but also a romantic she really believes in democracy she cant imagine that people like peus powerful rich allknowing entities that are shadows behind our american democracy may affect the wheels i think she very much believes in the people and the power of the people and doing things in the right order theres an equal and opposite truth that luna is a portrait of something she couldve been but would never have become mellie didnt hide the fact that she wanted the pomp and circumstance of the inauguration even though she might be killed because she knew the moment was bigger than herself how difficult or easy do you think that was for her to decide young i think she was very much on the fence thats the thing those last moments leading up to the inauguration really burned away any frivolity she had it was no longer a dream that was just for herself it became a very sober reality of what the opportunity was and what was being asked of her it became as public office should be a service not something selfserving so she knew if she lost her life it was worth it for everyone to see a woman being inaugurated she was willing to sacrifice herself for something much larger than herself im hoping that sort of humility and mindfulness is something that follows her into her presidency i liked the scene when fitz told her what it felt like to be shot and that he wanted her to cancel the inauguration hes the only person who can tell her from experience young yeah exactly what i love so much about that scene is of all the people in the world and particularly after all our years together on the show we met fitz and mellie in the worst moment of their marriage and one of the worst moments of mellies life they next year get to enjoy time on the balcony where they can remember the connection they had they spent decades together as partners working toward a common dream and certainly coparent but theres really not been any stable footing to think that a person who knows you better than anyone in the world is also the only person who knows exactly what youre going through i mean that is a party of one and if they really get to share that connection again and rely on each other like that oooh i look forward to that i wish thats something next season incorporates last time we talked you said your favorite scene involved quinn was that her pregnancy announcement young yeah how great was that i loved it so much i have no idea what next season will be i have no idea if well go backward in time or forward in time what i can tell you is i love the way its being handled and i love the opportunity that it gives shonda rhimes to talk about of course raising a baby and being a powerful woman and being the boss of your husband there are such rich gender politics in the workplace stories that arrive from that very common situation thats why its dear to my heart its just so real and relevant and quinns the perfect person to carry it forward and that its happening with the symmetry in real life is cool as well it makes it all the more sentimental she was the baby gladiator when the show started young she was the baby gladiator thats true i didnt think about that scandal returns in the fall

gossipcop-906823,1,is chris hemsworth done playing thor after avengers 4 hes had such mixed feelings about the role the dust has finally begun to settle following the intense events of avengers infinity war leaving fans wondering about the future of earths mightiest heroes with the next film the last hes officially signed up for is chris hemsworth done playing thor after avengers 4 or will the god of thunder strike again in the marvel comic universe unlike his brashly confident alterego hemsworth seems hesitant about picking up the hammer again though hes enjoyed working on the films so far speaking with usa today he confirmed this is it im done i wont be playing the character again yet moments later he admitted that he and thor ragnarok director taita waititi had loads of fun tossing around potential ideas for a fourth thor film i felt like we reinvented thor there is a bigger platform now to continue if we want to and yet its that if that has fans holding their breath as to whether theyll see hemsworth onscreen with the marvel team again originally the actor signed on for a total of four films with the asyet untitled avengers 4 the last hes both contractually obliged to make and confirmed for mcu mastermind kevin feige only adds to the uncertainty playing coy in an interview with observer with infinity war its coming to a climax and with untitled avengers a year later bringing what will be that first 22 movie arc to a finality feige confirmed before adding those stories will continue i think theyll continue in surprisingly different and unexpected ways after these two avengers films feige is quick to knock the idea that finality equals death if the storytellings anything like the comics the marvel films are based on some characters bow off stage for a while only to rejoin the fray when theres a compelling reason to bring them back continuing with floating thoughts about possibilities for thors future hemsworth told ign that when he worked on his franchises films i was enjoying it but i was like i felt a little restricted and after this last experience with taika and actually these last two avengers i feel like weve reinvented the character a number of timesi definitely feel a renewed sense of excitement and enthusiasm and more so than ever i think its a bummer that hemsworth felt a renewed sense of fun about the franchise just as his contract was coming to an end but at the same time the actor seems to be painfully aware of the stakes of signing up for another round of superhero action i want to be able to take the kids to school i may even be off all year he said speaking with the times my wife and i were talking the other day about how the years are flying by our daughter is five and a half and the boys are three and a half and however much time you do have together it never seems like enough still the lure of playing a god would be a lot to turn down for any mere mortal in a recent instagram post hemsworth thanked his fans directly in what sounded like a fond farewell instead of just shouting audiences out for making avengers infinity war one of the biggest boxoffice smashes in recent history the video also featured hemsworth saying thank you so much everyone who continues to support these characters and the marvel universe were going to keep trying to crank them out for you if you let us does that include himself as thor or is it a general nod to the entire avengers team its unknown but whats clear is that despite years of playing thor hemsworth still seems unsure of how he feels about portraying the hero onscreen the fact that the actors films outside the marvel universe have done less than stellar at the box office makes the god of thunder for better or worse the defining role of hemsworths career its a solid reason for him to have mixed feelings about taking on the role again so it seems whether fans will get to see hemsworth as thor again will depend on the kind of future marvel filmmakers can come up with for the character and if its interesting enough for the actor to deem it worth picking up the hammer once more

gossipcop-8741087043,0,the last action heroes have tom cruise will smith and brad pitt lost their mojo sign up to our free indyarts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviews sign up to our free indyarts newsletter sign up to our free indyarts newsletter email sign up i would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from the independent read our privacy notice independence day director roland emmerich sent shockwaves through hollywood when he declared that the films star will smith was too expensive and too much of a marquee name to star in the sequel scheduled to come out in 2015 emmerich had previously declared that it would be impossible to do a sequel without smith the aboutturn announced while emmerich was promoting his new film white house down this week is part of a changing of the guard in hollywood that has seen smith tom cruise and brad pitt lose some of their cachet the announcement also comes just as hollywood has seemingly deemed it no longer needs its three biggest male stars to launch blockbuster movies the knives had been sharpened for pitt when zombie thriller world war z was being designated a megaflop even before it hit cinemas with a budget rumoured to be in excess of 400m 260m including marketing it was being touted as this years john carter when the scifi adventure bombed last summer disney boss rich ross resigned from his post the film reputedly lost 200m the worry was that pitts name alone could not sell the picture in the end the opening weekend saw the pitt film take home more than 60m at the american box office and 117m worldwide the dire prerelease predictions meant that what were in modern blockbuster terms quite ordinary numbers were painted as a success with suggestions there might be a sequel while on the surface the numbers looked good for pitt they did not quite mask the new reality in hollywood that views starvehicle blockbusters as a risky commodity monsters university an animation film from pixar beat world war z to top spot in the box office other films released this year with production costs in the 200m budget range such as man of steel and iron man opened with weekends garnering well over 100m in the us alone the mixed critical reaction of the zombie thriller could also see the wwz box office plummet in the way that man of steel faltered in its second week for now pitt has at least avoided the boxoffice curse that afflicted his contemporaries earlier this year it seems laughable to talk about the former fresh prince having to rebuild his castle because after earth only took 27m on its opening weekend but to film trade magazine variety it was a crash landing there were numerous reasons why none of which looks good for smith since the 1996 release of independence day every smith summer movie has debuted at no 1 at the american box office but after earth came third behind fast and furious 6 on its second week of release and even more surprisingly now you see me a heist movie starring jesse eisenberg and mark ruffalo the number is also bad when comparing like with like of smiths previous films the gross is more in line with his lowbudgeted dramas such as the pursuit of happyness than blockbuster titles men in black and hancock all this points to why financiers believing there is no upside in paying smith a small fortune for the independence day sequel tom cruise seemed to be back on track when oblivion opened with a more than respectable 38m first weekend that was the second highest opening for a cruise vehicle outside of the mission impossible franchise and followed years of diminishing returns from the likes of jack reacher rock of ages valkyrie and knight and day but that was where the good news ended word of mouth was bad and audiences tumbled to such an extent that oblivion is yet another cruise effort to not score blockbuster numbers in america when not playing ethan hunt the last cruiseled film to break the 100m barrier was 2005s war of the worlds its commonly asserted that the start of cruises demise was his couchjumping proclamation of love for katie holmes on oprah yet cruise can argue that his boxoffice average has remained high since but take away the mission impossible franchise and the numbers are bleak before 2005 every cruise film for a number of years made more than 100m the fact is that these boxoffice figures for oblivion after earth and world war z would look amazing if the budgets for these movies were not north of 100m before marketing costs once you add the cut that cinema chains and homevideo outlets take on revenue movies need to make many times their budget to start being considered a success studios need a blockbuster film to pull in nearly 1bn theatrical another 1bn on dvd and a good multiyear sale on television for a 200m picture to be deemed a success indeed the high cost of releasing films is making filmmakers sweat at both ends of the budget scale steven soderbergh said he had to make behind the candelabra for hbo as the budget of the film was 5m but the marketing needed for an american release is a minimum of 70m numbers that dont make sense george lucas and steven spielberg speaking recently at the university of southern california predicted that there would be an implosion in the film industry and only bigbudget superhero movies would make it to the cinemas and cost 50 to see while lowbudget dramas would be made for ever smaller budgets and go straight to the small screen compounding the stars misery is their ageing audience threequarters of the spectators for oblivion that first weekend were over 25 younger audiences and families opted for monsters university over world war z while hollywood has increasingly been more forgiving about middleaged male action stars there has always been a tipping point where it becomes far more of a stretch to believe that they are taking on the world singlehandedly presently that tipping point seems to come at around 50 cruise was born in syracuse new york in 1962 oklahomaborn brad pitt will turn 50 this year will smith the youngest of the trio is 44 but the philadelphia native has nearly always banked on audiences buying into his youthful exuberance as a key selling factor pitt is the curiosity of the current trio fighting against the sands of time his box office has never been of blockbuster proportions the big franchise of his career has been the oceans trilogy which had numerous stars to share the burden his stardom has come from public perception and highprofile relationships but add up the american box office of his last three films killing them softly moneyball and the tree of life and the total gross is less than what benjamin button took home world war z is his big attempt at venturing into blockbuster territory and while the raw numbers gave pitt his highest grossing opening weekend they are not blockbuster and it seems that he has gambled a decade too late the three are such big stars that they even run their own production companies pitt runs plan b smith chairs overbrook and cruise founded cruisewagner productions they call the shots on their movies hiring directors working on the scripts and picking projects pitt staked his star name that he could turn max brookss novel into the start of a franchise the jury is still out studios now have more control over their product when stars are not involved this is especially true of superhero movies the exception that proves the rule came recently when robert downey jr caused a ripple by threatening to stop playing iron man the studio dithered no doubt knowing they could save a fortune by letting him go fans balked and the studio relented a hefty payday will see him star in avengers 2 and 3 a comicbook ensemble that doesnt need downey jr in it to guarantee bums on seats a caveat is that the appeal of the stars seems to have not been so diminished in foreign markets especially nascent territories such as china and russia there has been a big shift in hollywood studios attitudes in the last 10 years as the takings from foreign markets have started to dwarf those of domestic audiences so while after earth was deemed to have bombed in america foreign takings a week later softened the crash landing the reaction of cruise and smith to their boxoffice numbers suggest they are in consolidation mode cruise has abandoned plans to star in an adaptation of 60s tv show the man from uncle and announced that hes making a 5th instalment of mission impossible theres also talk that hes considering turning jerry maguire into a tv show will smith has been on american talk shows downplaying the weak opening of after earth and while talking about looking for more risks in his choices and moving away from blockbusters he has also been rumoured to be preparing for sequels of bad boys i robot and hancock although his men in black franchise has seen each sequel make less money than predecessors the stars are following the studios in relying on their bestknown characters to sell their movies whats intriguing is that there seem to be no successors to cruise pitt and smith the recent huge blockbuster franchises have been superhero movies batman and spiderman or ensembles based on books harry potter twilight and lord of the rings its hard to imagine christian bale breaking boxoffice records outside of the batsuit the summer blockbusters have evolved away from being star vehicles as studios have hit on a formula where they can call the shots thats bad news for the nontightswearing action star

bella began her journey back to a wwe ring and jim neidhart was a terrible tenant also also everyone still kind of generally thinks lana is the pits this becomes important later also i cant help but wonder how differently some of the ensuing hijinks would have been affected had nia been around to witness them andor intervene i have no idea why jax couldnt make this trip so alexa is rolling solo but gets some quality bonding time with nikki as theyre the first two to arrive in cabo it goes without saying that we are massive massive fans of reallife besties nia and alexa but its also nice to see how alexa rolls with situations without her lookingoutforlexisbestinterests muscle around during a photo shoot for birdiebee brie lets nikki in on the plan that shes throwing her an engagement party in cabo san lucas mexico this is the scenesetting for the entirety of this episode which gets out of control extremely quickly the divas are going to is a tried and true total divas trope but this one might go down as being the most infamous everyone but nia jax heads down to cabo in various groups which brings us to our next point of order she thinks shes quentin tarantino before the smackdown crew of carmella naomi lana and nattie get down to cabo they have to wrestle on smackdown while nattie and carmella are getting their makeup did nattie starts ranting about lana once again calling back the screaming argument lana had with everyone in florida about how they should work harder to get better at promos she thinks shes quentin tarantino says nattie to carmella and it legit took me 30 seconds to understand what the hell she meant by that at first i thought it was because of all the cussing lana did then i thought maybe lana was secretly super into feet it finally dawned on me that nattie was mocking lana insisting shes super good at wordstalkingwriting and picked qt as the example that came to her mind as an example of that incredible while nattie is shittalking lana overhears and strolls up to nattie who doesnt know shes there natties makeup lady cringes for a while before nattie finally looks at whos standing next to her as she says lana is just so much drama and looks suitably shocked before giving her an o hai just as a word of warning this episode marks the turning point where nattie becomes the greatest villain in television history and yes i listened to byron saxton on smackdown live this week bag full of penis things carmella brought an entire bag of penis things to cabo because she was under the mistaken impression that this was nikkis bachelorette party and apparently things in the shape of dicks are for that and definitely not for engagement parties the best thing is nikki acting offended like jesus you think five days at a mansion in cabo san lucas would be for something as important as my bachelorette party get a clue carmella to their credit everyone rolls with the penis stuff anyway and none of it gets blurred maybe this is the best timeline after all can lana and nattie coexist spoiler no in this one 1 episode here is a list of things that lana does to nattie continually try to get along with nattie enlist naomi to goodnaturedly and halfassedly tp natties room be subjectively annoying again insist shes good at promos possibly playslap nattie possibly after nattie slapped her first by comparison in this one 1 episode here is a list of things that nattie does to lana shittalk lana behind her back and fail to realize lana is standing next to her as she continues to shittalk continually ignore nikkis repeated and earnest requests to get along with lana so it doesnt ruin nikkis engagement party weekend move lanas things out of lanas chosen resort room and into a room on the ground floor because she finds lana irritating whip lana with flowers when she catches lana and naomi tping her room blame lana for ruining said flowers publicly announce lana is pregnant she is not definitely slap lana several times hard while dancing onstage at a club threaten to beat lanas fcking ass throw a glass of 800 champagne at lana as a means of proving a point throw lanas suitcase and cell phone off the side of a cliff run and lock herself in her room when lana asks if anyone has seen her phone hide in her room as lana makes threats at the door after repeatedly saying she wouldnt hesitate to lay lana out if provoked i should note lana did throw the rest of the bottle of 800 champagne on nattie but that was a pretty sensible retaliation i feel anyway nattie is absolutely insane in this episode and naomi tries to blame it on red wine nattie the episode ends with lana threatening to shave natties head and to strip naked so the producers cant use the footage if nattie doesnt open the door immediately the episode ends on a midseason cliffhanger i hope when the show returns nattie is replaced by one of teddy harts cats and they never mention it not even one of natties cats she doesnt deserve it

even more radziwill even blasting frankel in a scathing blog post calling her selfrighteous and claiming that her ego has gotten the best of her heidi gutmanbravo in july radziwill announced she was departing the show on her own terms saying in a statement to people that she was thrilled to leave frenemies behind and to move on to other projects frankel followed up days latter on twitter implying that it wasnt radziwills choice writing bravo has reasons for not asking hwives to return its based on research focus groups you aside from 3 years i left no rhony cast member has ever quit one saying they chose to depart attributing it to me is fiction its healthier to be truthful about a hard situation though they are no longer the best of friends radziwill did send love to frankel following the death of onoff boyfriend dennis shields earlier this month i just heard the sad news about dennis he was a good man radziwill 54 wrote on twitter my condolences to all his family and friends so tragic luann de lesseps friend paul cheneybravo frankel has been known to patch things up with longtime enemies in the past why just ask de lesseps the two were longtime rivals frankel even calling de lesseps a slut and a liar and a hypocrite and a snake during a berkshires blowout in season 8 but this year the og nyc housewives bonded and remained really close friends throughout sadly de lesseps wont be there to support frankel at the reunion days before its taping frankel helped de lesseps return to an alcohol treatment center luann is now surrounded by a core group of people who truly have her best interests at heart and who are working to make sure she gets the help she needs frankel told people at the time its a brave and honest decision by her and everyone is rallying around her and wants the best for her ramona singer foe heidi gutmanbravo this should come as no surprise to rhony fans though they both started the show together frankel and singer havent connected as friends in years things first started crumbling back in season 3 when during a chat on the brooklyn bridge singer said frankels relationship with now exjason hoppy would likely fall apart from there it only got worse when she returned to the show in season 7 frankel accused singer of stealing dresses then last season frankel refused to accept singers multiple apologies for bringing up frankels naked film past in the context of her young daughter bryn bethennys just not a nice person singer 61 said this season on watch what happens live with andy cohen later blasting frankel for not supporting other women she always has something negative to say about everybody and she pushes everyone away shes a bully sonja morgan friend paul cheneybravo heres another example of a former foe turning into a friend back in season 8 when morgan tried to launch her own booze business called tipsy girl frankel went off on her the skinnygirl founder saying that she wanted nothing to do with morgan and her nonexistent businesses what a difference a year makes with some distance between them and tipsy girl never materializing frankel and morgan bonded and when morgan 54 feuded with medley frankel was there to stand up for her im here to hold up bethenny morgan said on wwhl when asked about their friendship i cant do anything but that right now dorinda medley foe peter kramerbravo on the surface frankel and medley have a lot in common which is why it was surprising to see this pair on opposite sides of ongoing awkwardness all season long pinning down what happened between the two is much harder to do than say frankel and radziwills feud medley could sense frankels guard was up all season long and every time they discussed it it appeared to come down to frankel not trusting medley but they would make up each time and try to move forward eventually the two went on a trip to puerto rico for one of the skinnygirl moguls b strong relief missions where frankel addressed medleys alcohol intake you go to a 16 out of 10 and i need to really say it to you the way that you sometimes treat me is worse than singer frankel said i just cut you slack because youre a drunk medley has long denied that i dont have a drinking problem she said on wwhl we got to stop that topic tinsley mortimer coworker eugene gologurskybravo related video rhonys tinsley mortimer says shes teamcarole amidst housewife drama with bethenny frankel of all of the new york city cast mortimer seems the most indifferent towards frankel the two have never been friends or foes rarely sharing a scene together away from the rest of the group one things for sure mortimers closeness with radziwill hasnt influenced her relationship with frankel my relationship from carole is separate from that mortimer told people of course i am team carole but their relationship its sad i really hope that they work this out ive only known them being close when i met them they were best friends so i dont like to see that deteriorate or fall apart the real housewives of new york city airs wednesdays 8 pm et on bravo

looks exactly like pitt anonymous tips to deuxmoi claim that aniston is filming season 2 of the morning show on the same lot where pitts filming bullet train his latest film so it is absolutely

credited with influencing the revival of teen pop in the late 1990s350 rob sheffield of rolling stone wrote spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock roll teen queen the dungaree doll the angel baby who just has to make a scene351 in a review of baby one more time stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic described her music as a blend of infectious rapinflected dancepop and smooth balladry352 oops i did it again saw spears working with several rb producers to create a combination of bubblegum urban soul and raga353 her third studio album britney derived from the teen pop niche rhythmically and melodically but was described as sharper tougher than what came before incorporating genres such as rb disco and funk67354 spears has explored and heavily incorporated the genres of electropop355356 and dance music in her records as well as influences of urban and hip hop which are most present on in the zone and blackout in the zone also experiments with euro trance reggae and middle eastern music356357358 femme fatale and britney jean were also heavily influenced by electronic music genres359360 spears ninth studio album glory is more eclectic and experimental than her previous released work she commented that it took a lot of time its really different there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that ive wanted to do for a long time now and i just havent really done that361 baby one more time and oops i did it again address themes such as love and relationships from a teenagers point of view362363 following the massive commercial success of her first two studio albums spears team and producers wanted to maintain the formula that took her to the top of the charts362 spears however was no longer satisfied with the sound and themes covered on her records she cowrote five songs and choose each tracks producer on her third studio album britney which lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood sexuality and selfdiscovery67362354 sex dancing freedom and love continued to be spears music main subjects on her subsequent albumsa her fifth studio effort blackout also addresses issues such as fame and media scrutiny including on the song piece of me358364 spears music has also been noted for some catchphrases the opening in her debut single baby one more time oh baby baby is considered to be one of her signature lines and has been parodied in the media by various artists such as nicole scherzinger and ariana grande365 it has been used in variating forms throughout her music such as simply baby and oh baby as well as the blackout track ooh ooh baby on the initial development of baby one more time barry weiss noted spears inception of the catchphrase from her strange adlibbing during the recording of the song he commented further we thought it was really weird at first it was strange it was not the way max wrote it but it worked we thought it could be a really good opening salvo for her366 the opening line in gimme more its britney bitch has become another signature phrase367 an early review of blackout suggested the phrase was simply laughable367 amy roberts of bustle called it an indelible cultural turning point transforming a frenetic floundering moment in the superstars career to one of strength and empowerment367 voice spears is a sopranob other sources state that she possesses a contralto vocal range376377 prior to her breakthrough success she is described as having sung much deeper than her highly recognizable trademark voice of today with eric foster white who worked with spears on her debut album baby one more time was said to have shaped her vocals over the course of a month upon being signed to jive records to where it is todaydistinctively unmistakably britney33 rami yacoub who coproduced spears debut album with lyricist max martin commented i know from denniz pop and maxs previous productions when we do songs theres kind of a nasal thing with n sync and the backstreet boys we had to push for that midnasal voice when britney did that she got this kind of raspy sexy voice guy blackman of the age wrote that the thing about spears though is that her biggest songs no matter how committeecreated or impossibly polished have always been convincing because of her delivery her commitment and her presence spears expresses perfectly the conflicting urges of adolescence the tension between chastity and sexual experience between hedonism and responsibility between confidence and vulnerability379 producer william orbit who worked with spears on her album britney jean stated regarding her vocals britney didnt get so big just because she put on great shows she got to be that way because her voice is unique you hear two words and you know who is singing380 spears has also been criticized for her reliance on autotune381 and her vocals being overprocessed on records382 erlewine criticized spears singing abilities in a review of her blackout album stating never the greatest vocalist her thin squawk could be dismissed early in her career as an adolescent learning the ropes but nearly a decade later her singing hasnt gotten any better even if the studio tools to masquerade her weaknesses have358 joan anderman of the boston globe remarked that spears sounds robotic nearly inhuman on her records so processed is her voice by digital pitchshifters and synthesizers383 kayla upadhyaya of the michigan daily has provided a different point of view stating autotuned and overprocessed vocals define spearss voice as an artist and in her music autotune isnt so much a gimmick as it is an instrument used to highlight contort and make a statement384 adam markovitz of entertainment weekly opines that spears is no technical singer thats for sure but backed by martin and dr lukes wall of sound her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is in its own overprocessed way just as iconic and propulsive as michael jacksons yips or eminems snarls385 stage performances and videos spears performing on the circus starring britney spears tour in 2009 spears is known for her stage performances particularly the elaborate dance routines which incorporate bellydancing and tempered erotic moves that are credited with influencing danceheavy acts such as danity kane and the pussycat dolls386387 rolling stone

performances were lauded392 while her 2007 presentation was widely panned by critics as she teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words393 billboard called her 2016 comeback performance at the show an effective but not entirely glorious bid to regain pop superstardom374 after her knee injuries and personal problems spears showmanship and dance abilities came under criticism386394 serge f kovaleski of the new york times watched her las vegas concert residency in 2016 and stated once a fluid natural dancer ms spears can appear stiff even robotic today relying on

night396 it has been widely reported that spears lipsyncs during live performances387397398 which often prompts criticism from music critics and concert goers394399400 some however claimed that although she got plenty of digital support she doesnt merely lipsync during her live shows401 in 2016 sabrina weiss of refinery29 referred to her lipsyncing as a wellknown fact thats not even taboo anymore402 noting on the prevalence of lipsyncing the los angeles daily news opined in the context of a britney spears concert does it really matter you just go for the somewhatridiculous spectacle of it all403 spears herself has commented on the topic arguing because im dancing so much i do have a little bit of playback but theres a mixture of my voice and the playback it really pisses me off because im busting my ass out there and singing at the same time and nobody ever gives me credit for it397 in 2012 vh1 ranked spears as the fourth greatest woman of the video era404 while billboard

producers suggested she also used her dancers intuition to help select the beats for each track406 public image upon launching her music career with baby one more time spears was labeled a teen idol408 and rolling stone described her as the latest model of a classic product the unneurotic pop star who performs her duties with vaudevillian pluck and spokesmodel charm26 the april 1999 cover of rolling stone pictured a 17yearold spears reclining on a bed wearing an exposed bra and hot pants while cradling a teletubby in one arm409410411412 the american family association afa decried the

the big deal i have strong morals id do it again i thought the pictures were fine and i was tired of being compared to debbie gibson and all of this bubblegum pop all the time415 shortly before this spears had announced publicly she would remain abstinent until marriage27416 an early criticism of spears dismissed her as the product of a swedish songwriting factory that had no real hand in either her music or her persona vox editor constance grady wrote this was perpetuated from the fact that spears debuted in the late 1990s when music was dominated by rockism that prizes socalled authenticity and grittiness of rock above all else spears slick breezy pop was an affront to rockist sensibilities and claiming that spears was fake was an easy way to dismiss her ron levy for rolling stone noted that i have to tell you if the record company could have created more than one britney spears they would have done it and they tried406 billboard opined that by the time spears released her second album oops i did it again there was a shift occurring in both the music and her public image she was sharper sexier and singing about more grownup fare setting the stage for 2001s britney which shed her innocent skin and ushered her into adulthood417 britneys lead single im a slave 4 u and its music video were also credited for distancing her from her previous wholesome bubblegum star image418419

she has finally completed that journey and turned into britney the adult woman erlewine likened spears to fellow singer christina aguilera explaining that both equated maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs357 brittany spanos of la weekly stated that spears set the bar for the adulthood transition teen pop stars often struggle with420 spears erratic behavior and personal problems during 20062008 were highly publicized421 and affected both her career and public image358422 erlewine writes that each new disaster was stripping away any residual

gossipcop-875722,1,gwyneth paltrows goop touted the benefits of putting a jade egg in your vagina now it must pay we need to talk about gwyneth paltrows vaginal eggs again for the uninitiated these are the eggshaped jade or quartz stones sold through goop paltrows newage wellness company and lifestyle brand per goop women are supposed to insert said eggs into their vaginas and keep them there for varying periods of time sometimes overnight to get better connected to the power within for 66 one can buy a dark nephrite jade egg which allegedly brings increased sexual energy and pleasure or for 55 there is the heartactivating rose quartz egg for those who want more positive energy and love until recently a page on goops website promised that the eggs would increase vaginal muscle tone hormonal balance and feminine energy in general those claims were well a stretch with no grounding in real science according to a consumer protection lawsuit filed by state prosecutors representing 10 california counties on wednesday state officials and goop announced that they had settled the suit with paltrows company agreeing to pay 145000 in civil penalties advertisement specifically the suit called out goops jade egg its rose quartz egg and its inner judge flower essence blend as products whose advertised medical claims were not supported by competent and reliable science according to the santa clara county district attorneys office for example the flower essence blend had been marketed as a blend of essential oils that could ward off depression and the jade eggs they had developed a reputation and a backlash of their own last year the goop website published a qa with beauty guruhealerinspirationfriend shiva rose touting the products under the headline jade eggs for your yoni rose described the use of the eggs as an incredible secret practice by concubines in ancient chinese temples this practice is nearly as old as time many find value in it even if modernday research hasnt caught up yet or the practice will never catch its attention the page stated simultaneously brushing off any critics and creating an aura of protective mysticism around the eggs further down in the qa rose recommends tips for maintaining a jade egg if you feel like its been drained of energy recharge it in the full moon just the way you would a crystal advertisement last year a california obgyn wrote a lengthy open letter to paltrow blasting the eggs and their purported benefits as the biggest load of garbage i have read on your site since vaginal steaming but hey you arent one to let facts get in the way of profiting from snake oil jen gunter wrote the claim that they can balance hormones is quite simply biologically impossible pelvic floor exercises can help with incontinence and even give stronger orgasms for some women but they cannot change hormones as for female energy im a gynecologist and i dont know what that is gunter also warned that sleeping with a jade egg in ones vagina could lead to bacterial vaginosis or toxic shock syndrome and that it was an equally bad idea to walk around with them inside overenthusiastic kegel exercises or incorrectly done kegel exercises are a cause of pelvic pain and pain with sex in my practice gunter wrote imagine how your biceps muscle and then your shoulders and then your back might feel if you walked around all day flexed holding a barbell right now imagine your pelvic floor muscles doing this advertisement if paltrow was moved by the professional medical advice it wasnt reflected on goops website last year which published a followup letter to the editor titled 12 more reasons to start a jade egg practice that hit back at jade egg critics for sexually shaming a woman for sharing her personal experience a year later the consumer protection lawsuit in california may have finally succeeded in persuading goop to tone it down although the eggs are still available for sale on goops website gone are the claims on the product pages themselves that they will balance hormones or regulate your menstrual cycles according to california officials those who purchased either of the eggs or the flower essence from goop between jan 12 and aug 31 of last year are entitled to full refunds if they contact customerservicegoopcom or 1844wtfgoop yes that is the real phone number advertisement the health and money of santa clara county residents should never be put at risk by misleading advertising santa clara county district attorney jeff rosen said in a statement we will vigilantly protect consumers against companies that promise health benefits without the support of good science or any science however the qa with rose and the letter to the editor recommending people start using jade eggs remain on goops website although not technically part of the product pages the qa and other articles on goopcom continue to claim that the eggs cultivate sexual energy clear chi pathways in the body intensify femininity and invigorate our life force to name a few disclaimers at the bottom of the articles added before the settlement states they are for informational purposes only and not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice and goop maintained in a statement that the settlement does not indicate any liability on their part but rather an honest disagreement that the company wanted to settle quickly and amicably advertisement goop provides a forum for practitioners to present their views and experiences with various products like the jade egg the law though sometimes views statements like this as advertising claims which are subject to various legal requirements goop chief financial officer erica moore said in a statement the california food drug and medical device task force assisted us in applying those laws to the content we published and we appreciate their guidance in this matter as we move from a pioneer in this space to an established wellness authority this isnt the first time goop has drawn negative attention for dubious health claims about its serums vitamins crystals detox regimens and other products the nonprofit group truth in advertising has documented more than 50 examples of goop claiming that the products it sells or promotes can treat cure prevent alleviate the symptoms of or reduce the risk of developing a number of ailments ranging from depression

opposite sides of the debate about the role of money in us electionsa deluge of campaign cash is playing a significant role in kentuckys senate race thus farthe money raised by the campaigns and outside groups is expected to top the 100 million mark and go down as the most expensive in us historymore than any lawmaker mcconnell is the face of looseningif not eliminatingcampaign finance regulationsfor over a decade the gop leader has espoused that money and free speech are synonymous he has filed legal briefs urging the supreme court to reaffirm its citizens united decision and supports a controversial case to further deregulate contribution limits placed on individualsin a march 17 email to supporters grimes took a strong stance against the influence wealthy donors are having and calls out mcconnell as the chief architect and beneficiary of that systemspecial interest money has already flooded into mitch mcconnells campaign grimes said hes the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle and his karl roveaffiliated super pacs are clogging the commonwealths airwaves with negative attack ads enough is enoughour democracy is too important to be auctioned off to the highest biddergrimes has played it safe on the campaign trail when faced with thornier issues outside of core democratic principles such as raising the minimum wage but given the lefts apoplectic reaction to the roberts courts dismantling limitations and the rise of super pacs her position is receiving applause from watchdog groupsits very good that alison grimes has come out in support of a policy that puts regular people in charge of government again says david donnelly who is executive director of public campaign action fund she understands that money in politics drowns out the voices of every day kentuckians this is a sharp difference between her and mcconnell someone who is advocating the make the problem worsethe grimes campaign message also directs voters to sign a petition calling on congress to stop special interest billionaires that has the support of red state democratic senators such as joe donnelly of indiana and joe manchin of west virginiain the 2014

themselves pointed out its limitations in kentuckys senate racemcconnell has spent over half of the 20 million hes raised this cycle and he has a number of outside groups spending millions in advertisements supporting his reelection yet mcconnells approval ratings remain terribly low and grimes either leads or ties the gop leader in most pollingformer fec chairman michael toner says despite arguments that the wealthy are purchasing american elections those independent expenditure committees havent always worked out for candidatesone reason the federal courts over the years have not found a corruption threat at the independent spending is that sometimes its not that effective in directly advancing a candidates interest he saysa lot of candidates who spend more money than their opponents whether out of their own pocket or lets say supported by major outside groups their track record in winning elections is not that good to be honest weve seen a lot of multimillionaire candidates who are defeated in various races now to be sure some are also elected but by now means is the candidate with the most money spent on their behalf assured of being electedgrimes has raised 45 million since entering the race last year and been all over the country at fundraisers with big name democratic donors she outpaced mcconnells money machine during the third quarter and democraticaffiliated groups have also spent money attacking mcconnell in television adsthe mcconnell campaign was quick to point out that while grimes is criticizing citizens united she is also benefiting from attack ads against the senator from outside liberal groups who praise her positionlike barack obama alison lundergan grimes is obviously much more concerned with political convenience than constitutional protections mcconnell campaign spokeswoman allison moore told wfpl the sad part is that she apparently sees no irony in the fact the special interest group who successfully persuaded her to embrace trampling on our first amendment rights in the name of money in politics is the same one running hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising on her behalfthe top expenditures in 2014 have been super pacs with liberal viewpoints such as senate majority pac which has slammed mcconnell in tv adsasked about grimes wealthy donors donnelly says all elected officials and candidates are implicated but that what lawmakers do in washington mattersthe real distinction is what are you going to do to clean it up and propose proactively to make the system better he says

gossipcop-953474,1,11 waterproof makeup products you have to try seventeen picks products that we think youll love the most we may earn commission from the links on this page nothings worse than looking in the mirror on a hot summer day and realizing you have raccoon eyes because your eyeliner started running sweat rain and humidity can quickly turn the makeup look you slayed this morning into something that looks straight out of a horror movie but sweat doesnt have to mean sacrifice you can still beat your face even if youre expecting the humidity to hit 100 just invest in some quality waterproof makeup products that will preserve your look all day long even the best waterproof makeup tends to feel a lot heavier than normal makeup but that doesnt mean its necessarily bad for your skin according to dr marisa garshick a nycbased boardcertified dermatologist at mdcs dermatology and clinical associate professor of dermatology at cornell waterproof makeup certainly has a role for people who need it for specific reasons as long as it is properly removed at the end of each day but dr garshick also says that if your skin is prone to breakouts the key is finding waterproof makeup thats noncomedogenic since its less likely to clog your pores in general waterproof makeup can be considered heavier than traditional makeup and it is because some products contain ingredients that are designed to keep water away such as waxes or silicones and these can sometimes lead to irritation or further breakouts of the skin she advises investing in products that contain acrylates copolymer isododecane and very small amounts of silicone dr garshick says that you can even wear waterproof makeup to workout although it is recommended to remove makeup prior to a sweaty workout to minimize pores from getting clogged noncomedogenic makeup shouldnt clog the pores even if being worn while getting hot and sweaty it can be hard to break through the noise and find products that really work but this might help beauty smartie maria gomez tested out some waterproof makeup products which by the way are all pretty affordable and can be found at your local drugstore sure a bunch

love especially during the summer and spring time maria said 2 nyx gotcha covered concealer nyx professional makeup this product claims to be waterproof and full coverage maria dabbed the product onto her ring finger and only applied a small amount to her under eye area unfortunately the concealer did add some shine to her face it did add a little bit of shine im not sure how i feel about it because it kind of accentuates every little ridge in my face but it is full coverage so i will give it that 3 essence all about matt fixing compact powder waterproof ulta beauty according to maria this powder did a great job of removing some of the shine on her face however it did leave a little bit of a white cast hey no product is perfect right 4 rimmel natural bronzer rimmel london shop now

interesting concept but maria did note it felt a little different than other eye primers it feels a little weird almost feels a little sticky when compared to normal nonwaterproof eyeshadow primers

that long i actually really like this eye brow gel it deposited a little pigment nothing too drastic so it still looks pretty natural and it has a little bit of a gellike texture so my brows are staying in place as for the waterproof test this gel definitely passed even after maria dunked her face in water the pigment did not move 10 loreal voluminous lash paradise waterproof mascara ulta

gossipcop-897233,1,prince georges christmas list asks for only one present because he isnt messing around photos prince george of cambridge knows exactly what he wants for christmas and he isnt messing around during prince williams visit to finland he presented santa claus with prince georges christmas list not only does this mean the public gets to experience georges handwriting for the first time but we also have further insight into the 4yearold royals wishes and dreams for the perfect holiday in his letter not only did george circle that he has been nice rather than naughty this year but he wrote down he wants a police car he even signed his name just george at the bottom according to hello canada william told santa at the christmas market in helsinki ive seen you and i had to give you this letter he then added about his son he hasnt written down many requests so i think one request is probably ok william also made sure santa paid attention to how george was nice this year hes been a nice boy a nice boy he said george had the opportunity to list five presents he wanted for christmas but didnt he only wrote down one item and an important one at that you have you to admire his definitiveness unlike many children he didnt list a bunch of different gifts maybe hes hoping that by including one only thing it ensures hell actually get it its unclear if george is wishing for an actual police car or a toy version but it seems more than likely he wants the latter and thats what hell probably receive on dec 25 its highly doubtful his parents oops santa will gift him with his own police car that he cant even drive either way the fact that he has only one gift request speaks volumes he clearly isnt greedy yes hes a prince and is given luxuries that many arent privy to so maybe he already had so much stuff that the one thing missing from his life is a police car though william and kate middleton seem to be raising their children to be appreciative of what they have in life all while wanting them to have a normal of a life as possible as william once said about his children in a may interview with british gq i couldnt do my job without the stability of the family stability at home is so important to me i want to bring up my children in a happy stable secure world and that is so important to both of us as parents he then added about his son i want george to grow up in a real living environment i dont want him growing up behind palace walls he has to be out there the media make it harder but i will fight for them to have a normal life the 35yearold activist was also quick to recognize he and his family dont live the average life after being asked but surely you must accept it as an abnormal life he responded totally but i can still try to protect them as children based on georges wish list for christmas its probably safe to say that williams hopes of ensuring both george and princess charlotte remain children as long as possible is a reality so many kids these days want huge gifts like smartphones tablets computers or video game systems so to see that george seemingly wants a toy car shows his innocence and its truly refreshing the fact that george opened up his christmas gifts early in december 2016 according to kiss fm dj aj king via hello also shows just how much a kid he remains at heart i had a really nice chat with prince william who told me that this was their last week at work as it were before christmas king said william said they were all really excited about it and that george is already opening his presents he thought it a quite funny thats kids for you even the ones that are princes as for charlotte its unclear what she wants for christmas whatever shes hoping for is probably as sweet and childlike as her older brothers wish
politifact5276,1,america needs mitt governor mitt romney is a complex guy perhaps far more complex than many people give him credit for theres mitt romney the politician the facet of his personality that most people are familiar with and of course mitt romney the businessman there are even the lesser known facets of his life which include mitt romney the family man and mitt romney the mormon but how well do you know mitt romney the compulsive problemsolver the final paragraph in a recent article in the washington post by kathleen parker entitled mitt romney a nice guy in a season of nastiness provided a moment of epiphany for me which ill share with you at the end of this post heres the paragraph from parkers opinion piece that lit the light bulb over my head there are stories out there that tell another side to romneys character heres one related to me recently by someone close to the campaign romney was shooting an ad on a hot day in a staffers yard while the photo shoot was being set up romney was asked to bide time in the cooler shade of the staffers garage when the staffer retrieved romney 30 minutes later he discovered that the candidate had swept and organized his garage an anecdote like this sounds pretty farfetched to anyone who has bought into the snarky premise that romney is an outoftouch elitist millionaire who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth yet when you talk to people who know the romneys personally without exception they describe romney as the helpful nextdoor neighbor you never had but wish you did mittfittscom cartoonist sal velluto brought an interesting little video clip of romney to my attention that illustrates this littleknown yet endearing facet of mitt romneys personality the clip shows gov romney at the grand opening of the florida tea n tea party headquarters where he can be seen spending time afterwards mingling with the crowd and allowing folks to get pictures with him about 40 seconds into the video a gentleman presumably from nasa hands romney a nasa tshirt and romney who is reportedly worth about 250 million dollars gushes for me oh youre very kind and then he does something quintessentially romney while carrying on a conversation with the gentleman romney begins to neatly fold the tshirt with painstaking precision and once hes done folding he hands it off to an aide the nasa gentleman seemingly oblivious to the care with which romney has folded the shirt snatches it from the aide and unravels it for another photoop romney seems nonplussed as if he isnt even consciously aware that he folded it in the first place sometimes this facet of romneys personality isnt so subtle in july 1996 the 14yearold daughter of robert gay a partner at bain capital had disappeared she had attended a rave party in new york city and gotten high on ecstasy three days later her distraught father had no idea where she was romney took immediate action he closed down the entire firm and asked all 30 partners and employees to fly to new york to help find gays daughter romney set up a command center at the laguardia marriott and hired a private detective firm to assist with the search he established a tollfree number for tips coordinating the effort with the nypd and went through his rolodex and called everyone bain did business with in new york and asked them to help find his friends missing daughter romneys accountants at price waterhouse cooper put up posters on street poles while cashiers at a pharmacy owned by bain put fliers in the bag of every shopper romney and the other bain employees scoured every part of new york and talked with everyone they could prostitutes drug addicts anyone that day their hunt made the evening news which featured photos of the girl and the bain employees searching for her as a result a teenage boy phoned in asked if there was a reward and then hung up abruptly the nypd traced the call to a home in new jersey where they found the girl in the basement shivering and experiencing withdrawal symptoms from a massive ecstasy dose doctors later said the girl might not have survived another day romneys former partner credits mitt romney with saving his daughters life saying it was the most amazing thing and ill never forget this to the day i die so heres my epiphany mitt romney simply cant help himself he sees a problem and his mind immediately sets to work solving it sometimes consciously and sometimes notsoconsciously he doesnt do it for selfaggrandizement or for personal gain he does it because thats just how hes wired many people are unaware of the fact that when romney was asked by his old employer bill bain to come back to bain company as ceo to rescue the firm from bankruptcy romney left bain capital to work at bain company for an annual salary of one dollar when romney went to the rescue of the 2002 salt lake olympics he accepted no salary for three years and wouldnt use an expense account he also accepted no salary as governor of massachusetts for those who might be tempted to say that mitt romney is simply so rich he doesnt need the money consider what just transpired at the michigan gop presidential debate on november 9th by now youve probably seen video of the painful rick perry debate gaffe that has threatened to derail his presidential campaign during the debate perry boldly claimed that he would eliminate three federal departments in order to shrink the size of the federal government he named two education and commerce but then for an excruciatingly awkward 45 seconds he searched his mind for the third but for the life of him couldnt remember what it was he looked to ron paul for help and paul grinned and said something to the effect of you should cut five as perry continued to squirm and the other candidates watched someone suggested the epa and perry leaped at the suggestion exclaiming yeah there you go the epa no just kidding the moderator then asked seriously the epa and a deflated perry admitted with a nervous laugh no not the epa the moderator pressed perry and perry said no epa needs to be revamped but its education uh uh and from the left you can hear some say commerce and perry repeats commerce and uh uhi dont oops fifteen minutes later gov perry recalled that the third agency was the department of energy who was that helpful voice from offscreen who suggested epa and commerce the one person who twice tried to toss perry a lifepreserver while he was drowning while the others just watched him flail the one candidate who couldnt help himself because hes just wired that way even though rick perry has attacked him at almost every opportunity it was governor mitt romney copy and paste this code to link to this article on your website or blog share this article

politifact2093,1,this week transcript biden july 11 2010 jake tapper host i know that there are some in the white house who feel wall street reform health care legislation stimulus and yet the public still overwhelmingly thinks this country is on the wrong track are you not getting enough credit you and the administration joseph biden vice president of the united states look these are gigantic packages to deal with a gigantic problem we inherited and the vast majority of the american people and a lot of people really involved dont even know whats inside the packages and so you have for example mr boehner already calling for the repeal of of the reform that just passed on wall street people dont realize in that reform you know you say look weve had meat inspection for 100 years ago the meat packing companies didnt like it automobile safety 50 years ago people are going to look back on this very shortly and say why shouldnt we have some consumer group in entity looking at whether or not you can give someone a mortgage with no down payment with no with a teaser interest rate with no documentation etc so it is people dont know that just like people dont know a lot of whats going on in the recovery act understandably because this has been so much stuff that has been flowing our way and and were facing a bunch of guys who are good guys but theyre all about repeal and and repeat repeal what were doing and go back repeal the incentives for industry to invest in solar energy repeal the health care bill that allows you to keep your kid on your health care policy precondi preexisting conditions cant deny you policies etc its just going to take time this is jan this is july the election is not until november and i think were going to have to firmly make our case i think we can make it and especially in the context of whos going to be opposing us compared to the alternative i think were going to get a fair amount of credit by november and i think were going to do fine tapper so the reason youre not getting enough credit is because the public doesnt understand everything thats happened yet biden well nor could they or should they look in the last six months of the bush administration they lost three million jobs before we got our economic package in place another 37 million jobs were lost in the first six months we took office the last six months of this year the first six months of this year we created almost 600000 private jobs you know in the private market thats not nearly enough to make up for the eight million jobs lost in the recession but people are going to start to focus on exactly what were doing and all look im convinced at least from sitting around my dads kitchen table and and the people i grew up with is when things are really tough economically and the country is in trouble all they want to know is they they dont expect an answer but they expect to be reassured that were moving in the right direction that is tapper but they dont think that we are biden no no they dont think now because i dont think they know the detail of whats going on for example here you had the insurance industry spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make the health care bill out to be this god awful tragedy now whats starting off to happen the health care numbers are going up why because theyre figuring out that small businesses are going to get a 30 percent tax cut they didnt know that because of all the advertising done so theres a lot and and i would use health care as an example health care has gone from a barrage of advertising against it why it was so bad just like wall street reform the financial industry spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying against this this is an awful thing its government regulation all it is is rational control and the turning around of what the republicans did which is let wall street run wild people when you say to people you know we just went out and had a regulatory reform bill where i come from its like ok what what does that mean they dont know what it means yet understandably and so i think it takes time jake tapper theres that famous saying in washington by mike kinsley that a gaffe is when a politician accidentally tells the truth robert gibbs experienced some of that this this past few days biden ive never had a gaffe tapper youve never had an issue with gaffes laughter tapper no i know so you cant relate biden yeah tapper but but he said that enough seats are in the play in the house for the democrats to possibly lose the house empirically true how bad are the

politifact13431,1,tim kaines speech in spanish at an arizona rally read now democratic vicepresidential hopeful tim kaine on thursday delivered a speech in spanish at a campaign rally in phoenix arizona below are his remarks in spanish and an english translation good afternoon phoenix im so glad to be here with you all one of the core values of our campaign is that were stronger together that means we know that the only way to change this country for the better is by working with each other so its important to us to communicate with as many people as possible and to listen to as many people as possible and share our positive vision for america this country has a foundation that spreads out all across the planet it has roots in africa and asia many of whose people were brought here against their will but became part of the fabric of our society its rooted in native americans who have always been here and its enriched by immigrants from all corners places like ireland where my family first came from and people sometimes forget and some may not even know that the hispanic community has been part of our country since the spanish arrived in st augustine in 1565 that was well before the british landed in north america spanish was the first european language spoken in this country a few years ago i gave the first speech ever delivered in spanish on the senate floor since we were debating a bill about immigration explaining it in spanish just made sense especially since its the language of more than 40 million people in this country who are most affected by this issue i feel the same way about this election with so much at stake for the hispanic community it just makes sense to make the case for our campaign in a language thats spoken by so many families across the country i dont speak spanish perfectly but i picked up what i could while working with jesuit missionaries in honduras i took the skills i learned as a boy working in my fathers ironworking shop and i put them to use in the village of el progreso teaching young people carpentry and metalwork that experience changed my life and i have carried it with me ever since in every position ive held civil rights lawyer city councilman mayor lieutenant governor governor and senator what i learned in honduras comes down to three things fe familia y trabajo duro those were also the values i learned in my irishcatholic family in kansas city theres one other basic belief that hillary and i share do all the good you can and serve one another its pretty simple and today i recognize those same values in every state in our nation by people of all skin colors religions and backgrounds and in this campaign its been inspiring to see people from across our country coming together to address the challenges we face i believe that god has created a beautiful and rich tapestry in our country an incredible cultural diversity that succeeds when we embrace everybody in love and battle back against the dark forces of division presidential elections are always a choice between two visions for our country a choice between two candidates but this year its a little bit different its about america looking in the mirror and deciding what we see there this isnt just a question of a presidents temperament and experience although those are very important qualities whats really on the ballot is hillary clintons stronger together vision versus donald trumps frightening and divisive vision for our country so today i wanted you to hear directly from me that under a clintonkaine administration everyone will have a place in america latinos have always shaped this country from your service in the military to your spirit of entrepreneurship to your presence on the supreme court and by 2050 communities of color will represent the majority of our population so of course latinos will help shape the future of america because you are the future of america todos somos americanos we need all americans from all backgrounds to help write the next chapters in our nations story just as you have always done this community has been part of a long struggle that has shown your resilience and your power in recent years many of those battles have been waged right here in arizona in many ways phoenix was one of the birthplaces of the modern immigrant rights movement when people from all over the country came to organize against sb1070 a bill that went against so many of our shared values that battle isnt over right now in this election you are all leading the way in the next phase of progress but were up against some pretty tough opponents one of trumps biggest supporters sheriff joe arpaio whos facing criminal charges for profiling latinos and has persecuted undocumented immigrants he says he thinks trump will get a lot of hispanic votes do you think hes right just the other day your former governor jan brewer who signed into law the discriminatory sb1070 that promoted racial profiling said that she wasnt worried about her candidate donald trump winning this state because as she said latinos dont get out and vote do you think shes right i think jan brewer must not be paying very close attention because millions of americans are coming together democrats and republicans and independents to support hillary clinton and reject donald trump and everything he stands for here in arizona our campaign is surging more than a million people have already voted early and the rate of hispanic voters has nearly doubled compared to four years ago we are also seeing the same energy from the latino community in early vote in states like florida nevada north carolina and other states so i hate to break it to the trump campaign but latinos are going to have a really big voice in this election and the choice is really clear on the one hand you have hillary clinton someone whos spent her entire life working on behalf of kids and families she started her career at an organization that fights for children and their families at the childrens defense fund registering latino voters in south texas and fought fighting for universal healthcare and equal rights in other words shes lista hillary clinton is lista on the other hand you have donald trump someone who thinks latino outreach means tweeting out a picture of a taco bowl in the first weeks of his campaign donald trump said that immigrants from mexico are drug dealers rapists murderers in the last debate trump referred to them as bad hombres he insists that this is a country where we speak english not spanish he doesnt understand that multilingual and bilingual families contribute to the diversity that makes our nation strong he once called alicia machado the winner of his miss universe pageant miss housekeeping and a month ago he decided to pick a fight with her on twitter and in interviews for days and he attacked gonzalo curiel the distinguished judge in the fraud lawsuit against trump university now judge curiel was born in indiana his parents were born in mexico but donald actually said judge curiel cant be trusted to do his job because of his mexican heritage even the republican speaker of the house paul ryan who has endorsed trump said that was the definition of a racist comment judge curiel is as american as i am and hes as american as donald trump whether your family just arrived or has been here since before the united states even existed hillary clinton and i believe we are brothers and my sisters and we will be your champions youre our neighbors colleagues friends and families you make our nation stronger smarter and more creative and i want all of you to know that we see you and we are with you america is a better country because of you hillary and i have a positive vision for what we want to accomplish you know when hillary first called me up and told me she had chosen me to be her running mate heres what she said the definition of success in a clintonkaine administration wont be the number of laws we pass but whether we can make life a little easier for a working mother or help a child learn better in a classroom or help a person whos made a mistake get a second chance at that moment i knew we were going to be soul mates in this journey hillary and i are making two major promises for the first 100 days of our administration first well make the biggest investment in new goodpaying jobs since world war ii we need to create an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top and i dont need to tell anyone here that we still have some work to do to get there latinos are 17 percent of our countrys population but they hold only 2 percent of its wealth thats just not right weve got to connect more latinos with good jobs that pay good wages with more opportunities to go to college launch new ventures and build wealth that you can pass on to your kids one of the keys to that is small business hillary and i are two kids of two fathers who built small businesses and we know need to do much more to support the latinoowned small businesses that create so many jobs across america our plan will make it easier to start one increase access to capital and invest 25 billion in the communities that need it most and at a time when education is more important than ever for the jobs of the future well fight for universal preschool good schools in every zip code and make sure no one has to give up on their dreams of college because they cant afford to pay over the last 20 years the number of latinos going to college has tripled thats great news and yet latinos are still less likely than their white peers to graduate often because they cant afford to our plan will help change that were going to make community college free were going to make instate public universities debtfree and for families making less than 125000 a year well completely eliminate tuition at those schools thats how we can start to break down all the economic barriers that are holding you back second hillary and i will introduce legislation for comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship too many children in america say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home donald trump wants to create a deportation nation trump wants to deport almost 16 million people he wants to deport 115 million undocumented people and he wants to eliminate citizenship for 45 million people who were born in the united states to parents without documents undocumented parents and deport them as well this goes against one of the most important values in our constitution a person born here in the united states is a citizen hillary and i will fight against trumps divisive plan with all of our efforts one of my favorite things to do is go to the naturalization services where people become us citizens usually after the oath is taken theres an open microphone and people get to walk up and explain why they decided to become a citizen their stories just bring tears to your eyes and a smile to your face when you hear what they think about the greatness of the united states of america you cant help but think cualquier persona que ama tanto a los estados unidos merece estar aqu thats why were going to fight so hard for comprehensive immigration reform and in the meantime well do everything we can to keep families together a few months ago the supreme court put dapa on hold that was devastating for millions of families but its important to note that the court didnt actually rule on the substance of the case hillary and i have always said that dapa is squarely within the presidents authority and we will keep fighting for it we also need to end family detention close private detention facilities and stop the raids and roundups theyre not right theyre not necessary and theyre not consistent with our values i want to close by explaining why hillary and i believe that were stronger together its something that has always united democrats were not just looking out for ourselves were people who look out for those among us that need help in my church we talk about the story of the good samaritan theres somebody whos beaten up and lying at the side of the road and a lot of people walk on by people who should know better people who are leaders people who have titles they just walk on by i bet somebody walked on by and said youre a loser but then a samaritan who in that story was sort of an outcast says im going to go help him out today there are a lot of people in this country who on the side of the road asking for help maybe they need a job or need to figure out how to pay for college maybe theyre struggling with an illness or are a victim of violence maybe theyre being bullied or theyre just somebody who needs a second chance theyre all there by the side of the road asking for help hillary clinton and i believe that we cant just walk on by democrats dont walk on by arizonans dont walk on by americans dont walk on by thats just not who we are we go over and help and if we want this country to remain a place where we are measured by how we help others then we need every single person here to vote and we need you to bring your friends and families and neighbors to vote too for the first time in a while the state of arizona is competitive and every single vote counts tomorrow is the last day of early voting in arizona but why wait until then when everyone can vote today early voting is open until tomorrow the nearest early voting location is the maryvalecartwright school district annex building at 3401 north 67th avenue this election isnt just about where were going its about who we are i think were a country where we all belong a country that chooses love over hate a country that builds on the progress weve made instead of going backward that as we used to say in honduras goes adelante no atrs and to anyone who says that we cant realize that vision lets reply with the chant that has echoed through our history si se puede gracias phoenix lets go vote and lets go win
politifact3632,1,lets not be civil the new york times last week president obama offered a spirited defense of his partys values in effect of the legacy of the new deal and the great society immediately thereafter as always happens when democrats take a stand the civility police came out in force the president we were told was being too partisan he needs to treat his opponents with respect he should have lunch with them and work out a consensus thats a bad idea equally important its an undemocratic idea lets review the story so far two weeks ago house republicans released their big budget proposal selling it to credulous pundits as a statement of necessity not ideology a document telling america what must be done but it was in fact a deeply partisan document which you might have guessed from the opening sentence where the president has failed house republicans will lead it hyped the danger of deficits yet even on its own not at all credible accounting spending cuts were used mainly to pay for tax cuts rather than deficit reduction the transparent and obvious goal was to use deficit fears to impose a vision of small government and low taxes especially on the wealthy so the house budget proposal revealed a yawning gap between the two parties priorities and it revealed a deep difference in views about how the world works

season of the bachelorette waddell a singersongwriter on chris soules season of the bachelor also appeared on the previous season of paradise now the couple remains one of a handful of success stories

felt through sheer willpower that i could make it come back to life he now says i trust everyone thats a part of the show i felt like we knew it would come back in the wake of the season four investigation the amount of alcohol consumed on set became a hot topic as a result of the controversy paradise kept tabs on the casts drinking when they returned to set something harrison will discuss with the cast also on tuesdays episode though new paradise drinking rules were later put in place the newlyweds said alcohol wasnt an issue during their wedding no one drank that much it wasnt like a crazy affair bass says while waddell says she didnt even have time to drink at her own wedding paradise is a great parody of life says bass i love the fact that it sort of illuminates the absurdity of going on tv to fall in love its very american were ridiculous but its awesome and he still disagrees that paradise is a drunk hookup show something both harrison and abc reality chief robert mills echoed to thr earlier this week theres sexuality on the show bass says the parts that are shown are sort of the fun wild parts but theres so much more that happens like the hours that we spend with a potential significant other people dont really drink that much the show was more about relationships and discovering yourself waddell adds were so excited to watch the season the show has such a dear

has been competing in the cycling events as part of the canadian team prince harry and rocker bruce springsteen meet with athletes during the closing ceremony prince harrys inspiring speech in full i want to start by saying thank you thank you to michael burns and his team to all the amazing volunteers to our friends and families and to the people of toronto you have delivered the biggest invictus games yet with the most incredible atmosphere making our competitors feel like the stars they are one week ago i told you that you needed to be ready but even i could not have been ready for the scale of what we witnessed at these games i told you to be ready for some fierce competition but im not sure any of us were ready for a group of men from georgia who until three years ago had never even played the game to battle all the way to gold in sitting volleyball i told you to be ready to see examples of determination that would give you power in your own lives but im not sure any of us were ready to see mark ormrod with a medal round his neck hoisting his son onto his shoulders and capturing the imagination of the world i told you to be ready to see the true meaning of teamwork but who could have predicted how powerful it would be to see competitors from ukraine denmark romania and america band together to form team unconquered and win a sitting volleyball game with people they just met i told you to get ready to see role models that children would look up to but who could have imagined that randi gavell would compete on the track on the court and in the pool having battled back from emotional challenges and while four and a half months pregnant i think we all know who randis little girl is going to look up to i told you to be ready to see lives change in front of your eyes but i didnt tell you that some of those lives would be your own i told you that anything is possible if you have the will but i didnt tell you that when we saw triple amputee mike nicholson nail a 150 yard drive on the golf course that our idea of what we thought was possible would change forever i told you you would be inspired but i didnt say that these games might leave you questioning if you are living to your own true potential to the thousands who filled the stands this week and the millions who watched at home let me issue you a challenge dont just move on from these games with happy memories instead make an invictus goal for yourselves let the examples of service and resilience that you have seen inspire you to take action to improve something big or small in your life for your family or in your community lets create a ripple effect of the invictus spirit across our nations that will be the real legacy of this extraordinary week as i did a week ago i want to end by speaking directly to our competitors right now youre on a high at the summit of a mountain many of you thought was too high to climb you have done it this is the moment right here right now shoulder to shoulder you are invictus these games are not about gold silver or bronze medals they never have been theyre about the journey that you and your families have made to the start line now going home it might be tough as the excitement fades but you have faced much greater challenges before it will be a breeze as i have said many times once you have served you are always serving on your return home i want you to set a new invictus goal make a plan about how you are going to use the experience of this week to help lift up all those around you it might be something big like starting a new project for young people or it might be something small like reconnecting with an old friend it doesnt matter how big or small your step is just take it our world needs your dedication and passion like never before and you never know this may just be the missing piece of the puzzle to help you regain that satisfaction of serving others once again and id also ask for one more important favour i bet you can all think of at least one person who would benefit from the invictus games but has yet to find the motivation to make that first step when we gather in sydney next year i look forward to seeing familiar faces in competition but more than anything i hope to meet those who have watched these games at home who may still be struggling but with your support will wear their nations flag on their chest once again as part of the 2018 games and i want to see those who have competed this year back by their sides cheering them on as others have done for you the invictus games are not just for the already determined these games are for those who need it most please help us find them its gonna be game on down under ill see you in australia advertisement prince harry shakes hands with flag bearer

tan france fashion antoni porowski food and wine and bobby berk design will assume the queer eye for the straight guy fab 5 mantle once occupied by jai rodriguez kyan douglas carson kressley ted allen and thom filicia when the show which follows the stars as they give holistic makeovers to straight men premiered in 2003 on bravo it quickly became a cultural phenomenon even winning the outstanding reality program emmy the following year a lot has changed in the years since though its a new time with a new audience series creator david collins tells ew if the original round was about tolerance this time it is about acceptance which means audiences but especially each episodes subject or hero as theyre called will learn more about the fab 5s personal lives as they ditch the concrete jungle of new york city to take on straight guys in red states in order to make the emotions bigger you actually had to see how the fab 5 were reacting to being with a cop from the south who was a trump supporter or hillbilly tom who refers to himself by saying you cant fix ugly executive producer rob eric explains these guys walked away truly loving every single hero that they made over and talked about them for weeks afterward it affected them just as much as they affected our hero finding the new fab 5 was a blast collins says but still no easy task producers narrowed the field from hundreds to 40 guys after an international search with some silly amazing auditions earlier this year in la the result is an eclectic mix of personalities brown who appeared on the real world philadelphia stood out for his charisma and style viewers may know van ness from his hit web series gay of thrones or berk from his line of home furnishings producers have former fab 5er ted allen to thank for finding porowski he was the chopped hosts protg and personal chef and france originally from england is the creator of womens clothing line kingdom state and cocreator of rachel parcell inc serving as lead designer for both brands until this year each one of them is so unique collins says proudly not to mention fabulous above check out the exclusive first look at the new fab 5 and below collins explains why now was the right time to revive the show how the move to netflix has given them more freedom what he loves about each of the new guys and whether we might see any of the original fab 5 on the revival entertainment weekly in the couple episodes i got to watch the thing that really stood is out is how much more of a connection there seems to be between the new fab 5 and the straight guy than i remember from the original series these stories are so entirely different but so engrossing and emotional david collins its great to hear that storytelling obviously is ultimately the topline goal there is a format to the show its all in pieces there but for sure the episodic hero is our main focus his story and his interactions with the fab 5 its all about story always when i watched the episode featuring cory the police officer from winder georgia i wondered where it would go with him considering he wasnt in huge need of a physical makeover but that episode really proves its not always about the clothes and mustache and hair its interesting that you bring up the makeover part because a lot of times for us this time is makeovers are very important and the reveal and all that but really the bottom line is that inside change that moment where theyve had a revelation theyve had an understanding confidence breeds success has always been our through line there and thats one of those things that i have to say were really proud of thats come through in these individual stories theres a really powerful moment between karamo and cory as they discuss relations between police and black communities karamo admitted he was not excited to spend time with cory because of something that happens at the beginning of the episode did you have any idea thats how he was going to react laughs we had no idea how karamo was going to react and it really ended up obviously driving the entire episode and telling the story the experience of our fab 5 with each guy is realtime five full days with our guy so that conversation really got to grow organically and authentically over their time together and thats been something in the netflix queer eye that weve been able to do which is allow those relationships to really develop and grow over their time together on that topic what kind of new freedoms do you have being on netflix versus cable a lot there was the one gay day in the original queer eye and in this one we realized that the fab 5 and the time spent with our episodic hero was critical to allow a real authentic relationship to grow you gotta hang out you gotta have some coffee you gotta eat some bread those are the moments we realized really gave breadth to the story you see how the conversation grows and especially how the questions change the episodic hero says huh well i never thought of it this way but what about this and our fab 5 because we get to hear their stories now and see them and hear their journey as part of the individual episode its been a really great marriage of those two worlds why was now the right time to revive the show its one of those things that for me is really simple its a really great show and its a new time with a new audience the millennials dont remember the old show its got such a great heart and soul and humor to it so im excited for a new audience but i guess if there was something to be real specific if the original round was about tolerance this time it is about acceptance we ultimately realized that there was a great opportunity for the fab 5 to grow and be much more open about their personal lives if you think about the original five we definitely werent going to be talking about that tan is married to a mormon cowboy let alone that hes muslim laughs so its those authentic moments that really pay off in this new version of queer eye why now theres really an ultimate moment why not these are five guys who come in they help someone in not just the outward but the inward and ultimately weve always said confidence breed success and when they bring that confidence into someones world like tom when you see tom realize that he starts to feel good about himself you see it you feel it and the same with cory cory had such a great experience its been funny because we had to keep everything under wraps he is so dying to reconnect with the guys he keeps texting and sending me instagram messages because he really wants to stay in touch with them its been that its kinda cool which one of the fab 5 did you cast first the casting was a blast laughs we had a really large nationwide actually it was global because we had australia and the uk all part of our casting we had literally hundreds and hundreds of guys that we went through and we ultimately picked our top 40 and flew them all out to los angeles and had a threeandahalf day extravaganza like youve never seen laughs we brought everyone to the same hotel and we rented out this big banquet hall room and had some silly amazing casting going on the team really its probably one of those full circle moments for me when the first fab 5 were coming together the same thing happened it just starts to happen the chemistry starts to click you see that this guy and that guy are an amazing duo and then you add the third fourth and fifth and you realize wow this is a team each one of them is so unique what is it you love about each of them jonathan obviously it would be hard to miss how authentic he is hes so proud of being himself and hes so confident in himself because he really battled that he was the middleofnowhere kid who really grew up getting bullied hard he fought he really fought for being who he is he has no body shame he has no shame of his sexuality he is beautifully himself and authentic laughs and hes kinda funny too just cracking you up at every turn karamo is just the epitome of style and taste and class hes so charismatic he pulls you right in smart as a whip whats beautiful about him is hes an amazing listener he stops and really hears what everyone what the guys are saying to him and then hes able to really process that and bring it back its really a beautiful gift of his tan style and class he is the full picture there his sense of posh is just beautiful hes also got that edge to him hes a little like adele i used to say laughs adele has that gorgeous voice and she sings so beautifully and then when she talks shes got that cockney accent and will tell you how to shove it up your whatever tans got the same thing hes smart and witty but always classy bobby aside from being crazily talented hes so so good with what he does with his style and his design work bobby is a guy who worked really hard to get where he is hell tell you hes a kid who grew up with nothing and really fought hard to really do well for himself hes a hard worker hes a really hard worker and he brought that to the table he really cared about each of our episodes and each of the guys and bringing something special along the way and then mr antoni hes just so filled with passion and hes scarily smart he was actually ted allens protg ted sent him our way and we couldnt be happier hes got that adorable face and you just want to squeeze his little head off hes so so smart hes very well read and his sense of passion and taste is beautiful as well speaking of ted is there any chance well see the original fab 5 show up in any episodes with the new guys or does moving the show from new york into more rural areas make that difficult well im not going to say no or never because you never know but the new team is there and i cant say no because who knows maybe we will do something where they all come together but i think right now its the new show its the new fab 5 and they are definitely out there in the red states and seeing the world its kind of their moment and their time but definitely the original guys the og are thrilled for us thats probably been one of the most beautiful things is that everyone has been so supportive on this journey and really really loved each other the fab 10 as they are have all really bonded beautifully queer eye will debut on netflix in february

form and may be updated wolf blitzer host lets begin our questioning right now tom fahey of the new hampshire union leader with the first question tom fahey new hampshire union leader thanks wolf governor romney i wanted to start by asking you a question on which every american has formed an opinion we have lost 3400 troops civilian casualties are even higher and the iraqi government does not appear ready to provide for the security of its own country knowing everything you know right now was it a mistake for us to invade iraq mitt romney former governor of massachusetts well the question is kind of a non sequitur if you will what i mean by that or a null set that is that if youre saying lets turn back the clock and saddam hussein had opening up his country to iaea inspectors and theyd come in and theyd found that there were no weapons of mass destruction had saddam hussein therefore not violated united nations resolutions we wouldnt be in the conflict were in but he didnt do those things and we knew what we knew at the point we made the decision to get in i supported the presidents decision based on what we knew at that time i think we were underprepared and underplanned for what came after we knocked down saddam hussein by the way harry reid was wrong we did not lose the war in iraq and thats not the sort of thing you say when you have men and women in harms way we did however not do a great job after we knocked down saddam hussein and won the war to take him down and his military and at this stage the right thing for us to do is to see if we could possibly stabilize the central government in iraq so that they can have stability and so we can bring our troops home as soon as possible not to do that adds an enormous potential risk that the whole region could be embroiled in a regional conflict blitzer governor thank you but the question was knowing what you know right now not what you knew then what you know right now was it a mistake for the united states to invade iraq romney well i answered the question by saying its a non sequitur its a non null set kind of question because you can go back and say if we knew then what we know now by virtue of inspectors having been let in and giving us that information by virtue of if saddam hussein had followed the un resolutions we wouldnt be having this discussion so its a hypothetical that i think is an unreasonable hypothetical and the answer is we did what we did we did the right thing based on what we knew at that time i think we made mistakes following the conduct or the collapse of saddams government fahey mayor giuliani same question to you knowing what you know right now was it a good decision rudy giuliani former mayor of new york city absolutely the right thing to do its unthinkable that you would leave saddam hussein in charge of iraq and be able to fight the war on terror and the problem is that we see iraq in a vacuum iraq should not be seen in a vacuum iraq is part of the overall terrorist war against the united states the problem the democrats make is theyre in denial thats why you hear things like you heard in the debate the other night that you know iran really isnt dangerous its 10 years away from nuclear weapons iran is not 10 years away from nuclear weapons and the danger to us is not just missiles the danger to us is a state like iran handing nuclear weapons over to terrorists so it has to be seen in that light and we have to be successful in iraq blitzer senator mccain arguably going to war is the most important decision a member of the senate can make did you read the national intelligence estimate which included all the caveats on whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq sen john mccain r arizona i did not read that particular document i received hundreds of briefing tens and hundreds of hours of study and background and information on it and the fact is that the sanctions were breaking down the sanctions were not going to hold we had a multibillion dollar scandal in the form of oil for food the fact is that saddam hussein had used weapons of mass destruction before on his own people and on his enemies and if hed gotten them again hed have used them again that was his commitment and his belief that he was going to and we did the right thing the problem was the mismanagement of the conflict blitzer thank you senator senator brownback youre also a member of the united states senate did you read that classified national intelligence estimate sen sam brownback r kansas i dont remember that report i had a number of briefings and i held a number of committee hearings at that time i was chairing the middle east subcommittee on foreign relations and we held hearings on this topic and what was taking place and what saddam was doing but the issue is that weve got to put forward now a political plan and thats something im going to introduce tomorrow a political plan to create a threestate solution in iraq a kurdish state a sunni state a shia state because iraq is more three groups held together by exterior forces and thats what weve lacked is a political plan to get us moving forward in success blitzer thank you senator governor gilmore let me go to you you chaired this commission do you think it was appropriate that members of congress would authorize the president to go to war without reading that national intelligence estimate jim gilmore former governor of virginia you know i think the people who are in congress who are responsible for sending this country to war with the enormous dangers that it has geopolitically and strategically ought to read at least that kind of material i know they get a lot of stuff and they cant read everything but you know what wolf i think the true business is this the interests of the united states is in creating as much stability as possible in the middle east there is a very great danger to this country our interests in israel our interests in energy and in other ways there is a giant danger of the middle east becoming an unstable place saddam hussein was unstable and so taking him out was good there but we certainly didnt anticipate the further instability that was to come after blitzer were going to bring all of you in but i want to go to scott spradling of wmur for the next question scott spradling wmurtv thanks wolf senator mccain weve just spent a few minutes looking back id ask you to look forward now if you will since june 1st there have been at least 17 confirmed deaths of american soldiers in iraq approximately 100 us troops are dying there every month if our top military commander in iraq general petraeus reports back to congress this september that the surge hasnt significantly improved the situation on the ground what then mccain well let me say first of all i know how frustrated and saddened all americans are this morning i was with the family of matthew stanley of wolfeboro who sacrificed his life and our hearts and our sympathy goes out to all those who have sacrificed their lives in this conflict i inaudible think this strategy needs to be given a chance to succeed we havent barely gotten the fifth brigade over there which is part of this strategy i am convinced that if we fail and we have to withdraw they will follow us home it will be a base for al qaida and we will be facing greater challenges and greater sacrifices than that already made by matthew stanley and his family there is no doubt in my mind that this will become a base for terrorism there will be chaos in the region and when senator clinton says this is mr bushs war that this is president bushs war when president clinton was in power i didnt say that bosnia our intervention there was president clintons war when we intervened in kosovo i didnt say it was president clintons war what senator clinton doesnt understand that presidents dont lose wars political parties dont lose wars nations lose wars and nations lose the have the consequences of failure blitzer senator mccain we must succeed in this conflict blitzer the question was if general petraeus says applause its not working so far in september what do you do then mccain then you have to examine the options and ill tell you the options one is the division that sam described you would have to divide bedrooms in baghdad because sunni and shia are married to each other you have 2 million sunni and 4 million shia living in baghdad together you would have to you withdraw to the borders and watch genocide take place inside baghdad you watch the destabilization of jordan you see further jeopardy of israel because of the threats of hezbollah and iranian hegemony in the region all of the options i could run through with you my friend none of them are good thats why we must succeed and give it a chance to succeed blitzer all right now let me bring in governor thompson go ahead same question to you if general petraeus says its not working in september what should the us do then tommy thompson former hhs secretary the first thing the president should do is demand the almaliki government to vote as to whether or not they want the united states to stay in iraq weve been there four years give the government the responsibility of voting if they vote yes how are they going to help us win this war if they vote no we should redeploy our forces outside secondly there are 18 territories in iraq geographically defined those 18 territories just like 50 states in america should elect their state leaders and if they do so the shiites will elect shiites sunnis will elect sunnis kurds will elect kurds and you know something people will go to those particular territories and you get rid of this civil war internecine number three blitzer all right thompson i would like to have the oil revenue proceeds very quickly oil revenue proceeds split onethird to the federal government onethird to the states and onethird to every man woman and child and that will get everybody a stake in their country blitzer let me bring in congressman duncan hunter congressman if its not working at that point how much longer should the united states stay rep duncan hunter r california well wolf you know i read that nie report and i held briefings before we made the vote to go in and invited everybody democrat and republican to get the classified information and this depends the turnover of the security apparatus depends on one thing reliable iraqi forces youve got 129 iraqi battalions weve trained them up weve got a lot of them in the fight over the next three to four months we need to get them all in the fight get them that combat capability when theyre combathardened we rotate them in we displace american heavy combat forces off that battlefield and americans come home and wolf blitzer thank you hunter i can tell you as the chairman of the armed services committee for the last four years i have the credentials to leave iraq the right way blitzer congressman ron paul how much longer should the united states stay in iraq rep ron paul r texas the sooner we come home the better if they declare theres no progress in september we should come home it was a mistake to go so its a mistake to stay if we made the wrong diagnosis we should change the treatment so were not making progress there and we should come home the weapons werent there and we went in under un resolutions and our national security was not threatened were more threatened now by staying blitzer governor huckabee do you have confidence in the government of iraq applause the government of prime minister nouri almaliki that hes going to do what needs to be done mike huckabee former governor of arkansas i think theres some real doubt about that wolf but i want to remind all of us on this stage and the people in the audience that theres a reason that this is such a struggle and i think we miss it over here in the west todays the birthday of ronald reagan we all would believe that ronald reagan is the one who ended the cold war and ronald reagan is the one who helped bring about the collapse of the soviet union but theres a group of people who dont believe that and thats the taliban they believe they brought about the demise of the soviet union because of the way they fought in afghanistan and what i want to just mention is that it is not the size of the dog in the fight it is the size of the fight in the dog and we underestimate grossly underestimate how fierce this dog is and how determined they are to destroy every last one of us blitzer all right congressman tom tancredo what do you say rep tom tancredo r colorado ill tell you this that if it comes to that point in that time that you described that the surge is apparent that it is not working i did support it i hope to god it does work i hope im wrong i hope we pacify iraq however if it is apparent that we cannot then we have to do and tell the iraqis the exact same thing that benjamin franklin said when he came out of the convention in 1787 and somebody said to him dr franklin what have you given us and he said a republic if you can keep it it is exactly that time and it is exactly that thing that we have to say to the iraqi government we have given you this we bought it with our blood and sweat it is now up to you to keep it and i want the iraqis to be in fact patrolling baghdad if they need vehicles you let them have the vehicles but i want them patrolling their city and putting their lives at risk then we move out blitzer thank you congressman applause i want to go to the next question i want to go back to tom tom go ahead fahey senator brownback president bush has stated that states that sponsor terrorism are no different than terrorists themselves yet secretary of state condoleezza rice recently met with iranian officials to discuss security in iraq iran is a known support of hezbollah hamas did president bush make the right call in opening a dialogue with iran brownback i think he made a right call on saying that about terrorist states particularly iran but i think we have to at times talk with them in different situations like before we went into afghanistan we talked with iran it wasnt we were negotiating we didnt open up formal diplomatic relations and we shouldnt iran is the lead sponsor of terrorism ahmadinejad just this past week called for the destruction of israel continues to call for attacking of the united states on iraq i think we need to talk with them i think we have to confront them aggressively for what they are which is the lead sponsor of terrorism in the world i think we need to push the sanctions forward more aggressively i think we need to work with the labor union movement thats developing inside of iran you had a bus driver strike that recently took place and i think we have to show that purpose and resolve that were going to confront these guys and were going to stand with our allies like israel were going to stand against them oppressing and pushing us and trying to fund terrorists against us blitzer thank you congressman congressman hunter let me bring brownback senator if you dont mind blitzer excuse me senator brownback thats ok blitzer congressman hunter let me bring you back in do you agree with senator brownback that president bush made the right decision in opening a direct dialogue with iran hunter with two conditions and i think that you do have a dialogue with everybody whether theyre adversaries or friends the two conditions are number one they are moving deadly equipment across the border that is killing americans in iraq we have license to utilize anything that we want to use special operations intelligence whatever it takes to stop that deadly equipment from moving across the border and hitting americans in iraq and we dont give that up with these talks secondly theyve got about 1000 centrifuges now working enriching the material that can make at some point a nuclear device the united states reserves the right to preempt and we may have to preempt that nuclear weapons program we cannot allow them to have a nuclear device with those two caveats talk to your enemies blitzer if it came down to a preemptive us strike against irans nuclear facility if necessary would you authorize as president the use of tactical nuclear weapons hunter i would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons if there was no other way to preempt those particular centrifuges when the osirak reactor was hit in 86 when the six f18s came over the horizon and knocked that out they didnt need anything but conventional weapons probably its going to take a little more than that i dont think its going to take tactical nukes blitzer what do you think mayor do you think if you were president of the united states and it came down to iran having a nuclear bomb which you say is unacceptable you would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons giuliani part of the premise of talking to iran has to be that they have to know very clearly that it is unacceptable to the united states that they have nuclear power i think it could be done with conventional weapons but you cant rule out anything and you shouldnt take any option off the table and during the debate the other night the democrats seemed to be back in the 1990s they dont seem to have gotten beyond the cold war iran is a threat a nuclear threat not just because they can deliver a nuclear warhead with missiles theyre a nuclear threat because they are the biggest state sponsor of terrorism and they can hand nuclear materials to terrorists and we just saw it just last week in new york an attempt by islamist terrorists to attack jfk airport three weeks ago an attempt to attack fort dix these are real problems this war is not a bumper sticker this war is a real war blitzer thank you mayor applause blitzer let me bring governor gilmore in what do you say about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons if thats what it takes to go deep underground and destroy those iraqi facilities gilmore one of the central problems of the middle east is the desire for iran to dominate that portion of the world because of what they are doing and that is why i believe that they are seeking this kind of nuclear capacity that is one of the reasons why we are in fact in iraq and thats why our soldiers when they fight and die there are in fact serving the interests of the united states nobody ought to have any doubt about that with respect to iran the policy i would follow would be dual number one we need to work with our european allies in order to put in appropriate sanctions we need to communicate directly with the iranians that we are going to offer them an opportunity to work with us but we are also going to say that having a nuclear weapon is unacceptable they need to understand it and all options are on the table by the united states in that instance blitzer all right thank you governor governor romney i want to get you on the record do you agree with the mayor the governor others here that the use of tactical nuclear weapons potentially would be possible if that were the only way to stop iran from developing a nuclear bomb romney you dont take options off the table but what you do is stand back and say whats going on here you see whats happening in sudan and afghanistan in iraq and iran all over the world were seeing the same thing happening and that is people are testing the united states of america and we have to make sure they understand that were not arrogant we have resolve and we have the strength to protect our interests and to protect people who love liberty for that to happen were going to have to not just attack each one of these problems one by one but say how do we help move the world of islam so that the moderate muslims can reject the extreme and for that to happen were going to have to have a strong military and an effort to combine with our allies in such a way we combine for an effort to help move islam toward modernity thats what were going to have to do instead of looking at each theater one by one and saying well bomb here well attack here well go to sudan i watched the democrats blitzer thank you romney they dont think theres a war on terror blitzer thank you romney theres a war going on and we need a broad response to make sure that these people have a different vision applause blitzer thank you governor all of you are going to have an opportunity to weigh on all of these questions as well if youre hearing some sounds out there its lightning here in manchester new hampshire those are the crackling sounds that youre hearing lets go back to scott spradling thanks wolf congressman tancredo lets talk immigration tancredo ok spradling you oppose the immigration reform compromise calling it quote the worst piece of legislation to come down the pike in a long time just this morning in manchester you vowed to oust any senator who supports the bill including possibly new hampshires senior senator judd gregg whos undecided and says to your comments that you are part of the knownothing wing of the political spectrum in the meantime the president says his plan is the last best chance for serious immigration reform hes criticized conservatives for being obstructionists with that tension at stake if this becomes law what are the consequences for the country tancredo they are incredible and they are disastrous and that is exactly why i have said what ive said and that is why i have consistently tried to impress upon the american public the seriousness of this issue were not just talking about the number of jobs that we may be losing or the number of kids that are in our schools and impacting our school system or the number of people that are abusing our hospital system and taking advantage of the welfare system in this country were not just talking about that were talking about something that goes to the very heart of this nation whether or not we will actually survive as a nation and heres what i mean by that what were doing here in this immigration battle is testing our willingness to actually hold together as a nation or split apart into a lot of balkanized pieces we are testing our willingness to actually hold on to something called the english language something that is the glue that is supposed to hold us together as a nation we are becoming a bilingual nation and that is not good and that is the fearful part of this the ramifications are much much more significant than any that weve been discussing so far and so yes i have said dramatic things and yes i am willing to do whatever is necessary to try to stop this piece of legislation and that includes go after any republican that votes for it because the republicans can stop this blitzer thank you thank you congressman applause mayor giuliani what do you think the consequences for the nation are if this immigration plan proposed by president bush goes through giuliani the problem with this immigration plan is it has no real unifying purpose its a typical washington mess its everybody compromises four or five compromises and the compromises leave you with the following conclusion the litmus test you should have for legislation is is it going to make things better and when you look at these compromises it is quite possible it will make things worse the organizing purpose should be that our immigration laws should allow us to identify everyone who is in this country that comes here from a foreign country they should have a tamperproof id card it should be in a database that allows you to figure out who they are why theyre here make sure theyre not illegal immigrants coming here for a bad purpose and then to be able to throw out the ones who are not in that database we can do that credit card companies blitzer thank you giuliani take care of data that is greater than that blitzer thank you mayor i want to get to senator mccain in a moment but first governor romney senator mccain has accused you of flipflopping on this issue in effect yesterday in miami he said the following pandering for votes on this issue while offering no solution to the problem amounts to doing nothing and doing nothing is silent amnesty what do you say to senator mccain romney well hes my friend he campaigned for me two times i consider him a friend im not going to make this a matter of personal politics its an issue thats way too important for that my view is that we should enforce our immigration laws and this bill unfortunately has at least one provision thats a real problem its the z visa and what it allows is people who have come here illegally to stay here for the rest of their lives not necessarily as citizens they have to wait 13 years to become citizens thats not the point the point is every illegal alien almost every one under this bill gets to stay here thats not fair to the millions and millions of people around the world that would love to come here join with family members bring skill and education that we need its simply not fair to say those people get put ahead in the line of all the people whove been waiting legally to come to this country applause blitzer all right senator mccain this is your chance id like you to respond as someone who is the coauthor of this legislation mccain well first of all i agree with judd gregg hes a great senator applause second of all rudy you just described our legislation so id be glad to have further conversation with you because it does account for people who are here illegally it does have an employment verification system and it weeds out those who shouldnt be here and it gives others a chance to remain in this country look this is a national security issue first and foremost ever since 911 its a national security issue people came to fort dix new jersey from across our southern border and tried to kill our soldiers for us to do nothing is silent and de facto amnesty what we have done is what you expect us to do my friends and thats come together with the president of the united states the leader of our party democrat and republican conservative republicans like jon kyl johnny isakson saxby chambliss and trent lott and sit down and figure out an approach to this problem and it is a serious national security problem we need to act my friends and if someone else has a better idea id love to have them pursue give it to us blitzer thank you senator laughter applause hold on mccain that can get blitzer senator crosstalk audience member a better idea mccain that will get the support of enough people so that we can pass legislation this isnt the bill that i would have written but it does blitzer all right thank you mccain it does satisfy our national security challenges which are severe and intense and we cannot 12 million people washing around america illegally my friends crosstalk mccain and i hope youll examine the legislation blitzer thank you senator mccain and i hope we can move forward with it and we can make it better blitzer all right mccain but its our job to do the hard things blitzer mayor go ahead mccain not the easy things applause giuliani ive read the 400 pages and this is part of the problem in washington they say things and then its not in the legislation there are four or five different methods of identification not one it does not provide information about who exited the united states now tell me how youre going to figure out whos in the united states if you cant figure out whos left the united states and finally it doesnt provide for a uniform database many countries have this the united states doesnt have it on september 11th when we tried to figure out who was in this country it took weeks to figure out who were the right people and who werent because there isnt such a database and that is a fatal flaw in this legislation and wishing it away doesnt make it possible applause blitzer governor romney what would you do with the 12 million or so illegal immigrants who are right now in this country romney well one is to enforce the law as it exists the law that was passed in 1986 applause the law passed in 1986 asked for us to secure the border and said also to put in place an employment verification system neither one of those was done so lets make sure that we enforce the law as it exists and if you want to improve this bill well one thing you could do to make it better is to take that z visa and make it temporary instead of a permanent right to stay in america thats simply just not fair applause blitzer i want to stay on immigration everybodys going to have a chance to weigh in but lets go back to tom for another question on immigration fahey congressman hunter whether we like it or not in cities across america counties across america including your district in san diego illegal immigrants are doing jobs that american citizens dont want working on farms in hotels restaurants if you have your way and they all leave this country whos going to fill those jobs hunter well first i disagree with that premise because when they made the sweep on the swift plants those were the meat packaging plants in iowa took out some 850 people who were working there illegally several months ago there were american citizens lined up the next day to get their jobs back at 18 bucks an hour and let me tell you this is a disastrous bill and john mccain is right in saying that this is a national security issue and it is border enforcement then the hunter bill which was signed by the president on the 26th of october mandating 854 miles of double fence not that scraggly little fence you show on cnn all the time wolf that people get across so easily if they get across my fence we sign them up for the olympics immediately laughter weve got a big fence but 854 miles of double border fence was mandated to be constructed homeland security has a billion bucks cash on hand its been six months and theyve done 11 miles so this administration has a case of the slows and i think they slowed the fence down so that they could come out with the amnesty at the same time put the two together and the bushmccainkennedy bill would then be accepted by conservatives and liberals alike its a bad bill blitzer thank you congressman applause senator brownback what do you say about this notion of a pathway toward citizenship for these 12 million illegal immigrants who are in the country right now under what circumstances would you let them begin that path brownback i dont think you create any new paths to citizenship but i also think you allow them to be able to use paths that they would currently qualify for and to be able to get in the back of the line and thats part of leadership and getting something resolved i think you know we can go on a lot of slogans here and ive been around this issue for a while i was in congress in 1994 elected then we did the first immigration bill i was involved in then in 1996 you know what that was an enforcementonly bill in 1996 and we had 7 million undocumented here in the country then were at 12 million to 20 million now the point of saying that and my colleagues and people up here everybody is concerned that we get something done and get something right i think if you do exterior enforcement border enforcement you do aggressive interior enforcement and then you work on a comprehensive solution interior thats something that a lot of people are going to be upset with but that can work and move us forward and its better than not doing anything blitzer thank you so you support this pending compromise legislation brownback if we can hold together those things in it those things have to be in it blitzer youre with senator mccain brownback if those things are in it blitzer what about you governor thompson thompson wolf the first thing you have to do is youve got to secure the border securing the border is going to allow everything else to follow but unless you secure the border it is not right to give 12 million individuals who have illegal rights in this country status before that border is protected there should be no amnesty and this bill no matter how you cover it is an amnesty bill and the people in this country do not believe in that bill and they believe very much that the best hope for us to have a secure border just like congressman hunter has been talking about and every other republican up here have a secure border then move on but dont do it the other way blitzer thank you governor congressman paul i want you to weigh in on this as well i believe and correct me if im wrong you voted to support that 700mile fence along the border between the united states and mexico did you paul i did blitzer what about canada is there a need for a similar fence along the border between paul no blitzer the united states and canada paul no because that bill probably the fence was my weakest reason for doing that but for other reasons to enforce the law was important and border security is important and we talked about amnesty which im positively opposed to but one thing that has not been mentioned here which i think is very very important if you subsidize something you get more of it so we subsidize illegal immigration we reward it by easy citizenship either birthright or amnesty but we force our states and our local communities to pay for the health care to pay for the education why wouldnt they bring their families and because of our economic conditions we do need workers but if we had a truly freemarket economy the illegal immigrants would not be the scapegoat we would probably need them and they would be acceptable but because of economic conditions they have become the scapegoat blitzer thank you congressman applause blitzer the other night sunday night i asked the eight democratic presidential candidates whether or not they thought english should be the official language of the united states only one of them said english should be the official language of the united states if theres someone here who doesnt believe english should be the official language of the united states please speak up right now mccain i think its fine i would like to remind you that we made treaties with native americans such as the navajos in my state where we respect their sovereignty and they use their native language in their deliberations its not a big deal but native americans are important to me in my state everybody knows that english has to be learned if anyone ever wants to move up the economic ladder that is obvious and part of our legislation by the way is a requirement to learn english and by the way 30 percent of the people who are in this country illegally never came across our borders my friends they overstayed their visas thats why it has to be a comprehensive approach and im proud of the support of the president and his brother governor jeb bush who was governor of the state of florida people who have to deal with this issue every day understand we have to act my friends and we can have our own ways to improve it but if we dont address this issue we are going to pay a heavy price because something bad could happen when 12 million people are in this country illegally 2 million of them having committed serious crimes applause blitzer i see people raising their hands but the question was id only like those to speak up who believe that english should not necessarily be the official language of the united states is there anyone else who stands with senator mccain specifically on that question all right were going to go back to scott go ahead scott crosstalk blitzer scott go ahead hunter wolf if ive got if i have reservations in my district can i speak up also blitzer youll have an opportunity go ahead scott spradling ok this questions for governor gilmore conservative credentials is the topic sir youve gotten a lot of mileage out of lumping messrs giuliani mccain and romney together by calling them rudy mcromney laughter now with former senator fred thompson likely to join you at the next debate in your opinion is he conservative enough for america or are we changing the name now to rudy mcromneyson laughter gilmore well weve gotten a little mileage out of rudy mcromney i know the mayor one time said that it would make a good ticket and it would but it isnt a conservative ticket and we dont know what fred thompson is either i think hes a fine man he served in the senate a term and a half lets see exactly what his views are im coming forward and offering my views as a 40year battler for conservative values and conservative principles on behalf of the people of the united states and i have the record to back it up ive been a prosecutor ive been an attorney general ive been a governor i governed as a conservative i cut taxes for the people of the commonwealth of virginia ive stood by these principles for years and years the question is that when fred thompson comes into the race as i believe he will and maybe even speaker gingrich may come into the race theyll have to stand on their records and stand on their credentials and offer their ideas the same way that every person here on the stage is doing i look forward to that day and i look forward to the debate blitzer thank you governor governor thompson is there a need for another thompson in this race laughter thompson i think that anybody with a thompson name should get involved if they want to get involved its a great name hes a great candidate and i think it will help the republican party to have him in i just would like to say that if youre talking about conservatism and thats what youre talking about there isnt a candidate on either side of the aisle that has had as many vetoes as i have nobody has reduced taxes as much as i have and if youre talking about a reliable conservative it is this thompson tommy thompson not the other thats the conservative laughter blitzer thank you governor thank you governor mayor giuliani there was some news here today a catholic bishop in rhode island said some words about your position on abortion suggesting that it was similar to pontius pilates personal opposition to jesus christs crucifixion but allowing it to happen anyway how does that make you feel when you hear words like that from a catholic bishop giuliani well catholic bishop any religion inaudible blitzer thats the lightning thats having an effect on our system giuliani i know laughter i guess im here by myself look for someone who went to parochial schools all his life this is a very frightening thing thats happening right now laughter but the reality is i respect you know the opinion of catholic inaudible and religious leaders of all kinds religion is very important to me its a very important part of my life but ultimately as inaudible been in public life most of my life and taken oaths of office to enforce the law ive got to make the decisions that i think are the right ones in a country like ours and my view on abortion is that its wrong but that ultimately government should not be enforcing that decision on a woman that is my view that i i consult my religion i consult my reading of the constitution i consult my views of what i think are important in a pluralistic society and the reality that we have to respect the fact that there are people that are equally as religious equally as moral that make a different decision about this and should government put them in jail blitzer you made governor romney this decision on abortion opposing abortion relatively recently why should conservatives out there people who oppose abortion believe you romney well people can look at my record im not going to apologize for the fact that i became prolife i served as governor as i was governor as we were debating cloning and as we were debating also embryo farming i said roe v wade has gone too far i want to make it very clear that im prolife people here in new hampshire have seen that i fought for life i fought also for traditional marriage to keep taxes down to have education in our schools that includes abstinence education ive fought for english immersion in our schools they know that ive got conservative credentials and thats one of the things that brings me to this race but theres something bigger in conservatism that i dont think weve spoken about and that is that america is a land of opportunity and our future is going to be far brighter than our past not just as we overcome these challenges but as we take advantage of the new opportunity of the 21st century blitzer thank you very much governor lets go back to tom for the next question applause fahey inaudible do not believe in evolution youre an ordained minister what do you believe is it the story of creation as it is reported in the bible or described in the bible huckabee its interesting that that question would even be asked of somebody running for president im not planning on writing the curriculum for an 8thgrade science book im asking for the opportunity to be president of the united states but youve raised the question so let me answer it in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth to me its pretty simple a person either believes that god created this process or believes that it was an accident and that it just happened all on its own and the basic question was an unfair question because it simply asked us in a simplistic manner whether or not we believed in my view whether there is a god or not well let me be very clear i believe there is a god i believe theres a god who was active in the creation process now how did he do it and when did he do it and how long did he take i dont honestly know and i dont think knowing that would make me a better or a worse president but ill tell you what i can tell this country if they want a president who doesnt believe in god theres probably plenty of choices but if im selected as president of this country theyll have one who believes in those words that god did create and as the words of martin luther here i stand i can do no other and i will not take that back applause blitzer governor but i think the specific question is do you believe literally it was done in six days and it occurred 6000 years ago huckabee no i did answer that wolf i said i dont know my point is i dont know i wasnt there laughter but i believe whether god did it in six days or whether he did it in six days that represented periods of time he did it and thats whats important but you know if anybody wants to believe that they are the descendants of a primate they are certainly welcome to do it i dont know how far they will march that back but i believe that all of us in this room are the unique creations of a god who knows us and loves us and who created us for his own purpose applause blitzer senator brownback you recently elaborated on your position on this and i wonder if youd want to spend 30 seconds and tell our audience out there where you stand on the issue of evolution brownback id be happy to and its interesting that were doing this here at st anselms who this that saint had a philosophy of faith seeking reason and thats the issue thats missing here if i could highlight that point is that i believe that we are created in the image of god for a particular purpose and i believe that with all my heart and im somebody ive had cancer in the past ive had a season to really look at this and study it and think about the end of life and i am fully convinced theres a god of the universe that loves us very much and was involved in the process how he did it i dont know one of the problems we have with our society today is that weve put faith and science at odds with each other they arent at odds with each other if they are check your faith or check your science and we should have a discussion blitzer thank you brownback and we should engage faith and reason like st anselm did blitzer thank you brownback thats something we should do blitzer thank you senator brownback applause senator mccain do you believe creationism should be taught alongside evolution in the nations schools mccain no i believe that thats up to the school districts but i think that every american should be exposed to all theories but i cant say it more eloquently than pastor huckabee governor huckabee just did and i admire his description because i hold that view the point is that the time before time theres no doubt in my mind that the hand of god was in what we are today and i do believe that we are unique and i believe that god loves us but i also believe that all of our children in school can be taught different views on different issues but i leave the curricula up to the school boards blitzer thank you senator for that governor romney there was a recent poll here in new hampshire ten percent said they wouldnt vote for you because youre a mormon and last week we saw that picture of that man who refused to shake your hand because you are a mormon what would you like to say to the voters out there tonight about your faith about yourself and about god romney well president kennedy some time ago said he was not a catholic running for president he was an american running for president and im happy to be a proud member of my faith you know i think its a fair question for people to ask what do you believe and i think if you want to understand what i believe you could recognize that the values that i have are the same values youll find in faiths across this country i believe in god believe in the bible believe jesus christ is my savior i believe that god created man in his image i believe that the freedoms of man derive from inalienable rights that were given to us by god and i also believe that there are some pundits out there that are hoping that ill distance myself from my church so that thatll help me politically and thats not going to happen applause blitzer thank you governor for that congressman paul you ran for president once before as a libertarian what do you say about this whole issue of church and state and these issues that are coming forward right now paul well i think we should read the first amendment where it says congress shall write no law and we should write a lot less laws regarding this matter it shouldnt be a matter of the president or the congress it should be local people local officials the state should determine so many of these things that we just dont need more laws determining religious things or prayer in schools we should allow people at the local level thats what the constitution tells us we dont need somebody in washington telling us what we can do because we dont have perfect knowledge and thats the magnificence of our constitution and our republic we sort out the difficult problems at local levels and we dont have you know onecasefit all because you have a supreme court ruling like on roe v wade it ruined it for the whole country and thats why we shouldnt have it at a central level blitzer thank you congressman applause lets go back to another question from tom fahey this is for mayor giuliani sea levels around the world are rising average temperatures are increasing a un report written by scientists from 113 countries recently said that climate change is very likely manmade and may affect us for centuries to come is science wrong on global warming and what if any steps would you take as president to address the issue of climate change giuliani i think we have to accept the view that scientists have that there is global warming and that human operation human condition contributes to that and the fact is that there is a way to deal with it and to address it in a way that we can also accomplish energy independence which we need as a matter of national security its frustrating and really dangerous for us to see money going to our enemies because we have to buy oil from certain countries we should be supporting all the alternatives we need a project similar to putting a man on the moon that project started with eisenhower it was carried out by kennedy and then johnson and then nixon and that was two democrats and two republicans working inaudible democrats working in the national interest blitzer thank you thank you mayor i want governor romney to weigh in as well theres a perception at least among some that republicans are at least the republican party very close to big oil a lot of americans are suffering now from the price of gasoline high price of gasoline what do you say to the audience out there who believes that theres too much of an alliance if you will between the big oil companies and republicans romney well first of all rudy giuliani is right in terms of an apollo project to get us to energy independent and the effects of that on global warming are positive its a noregrets policy its a great idea secondly with regards to big oil big oil is making a lot of money right now and id like to see them using that money to invest in refineries dont forget that when companies earn profit that moneys supposed to be reinvested in growth and our refineries are old someone said to me matt simmons an investment banker down in houston he said our refineries today are rust with paint holding them up and we need to see these companies if theyre making that kind of money reinvest in capital equipment but lets not forget that where the money is being made this year is not just and throughout these years is not just in exxon and shell and the major oil companies its in the countries that own this oil russia last year took in 500 billion by selling oil ahmadinejad putin chavez these people are getting rich off of people buying too much oil and thats why we have to pursue as a strategic imperative energy independence for america and it takes that apollo project it also takes biodiesel biofuel ethanol blitzer thank you romney cellulosic ethanol nuclear power more drilling in anwr we have to be serious also about efficiency blitzer thank you governor romney and thats going to allow us to become energy independent blitzer senator mccain do you have a problem at this time with these oil companies making these huge profits mccain sure i think we all do and they ought to be reinvesting it and one of the areas that they ought to be involved in is nuclear power nuclear power is safe nuclear power is green does not emit greenhouse gases nuclear power is used on navy ships which have sailed around the world for 60 years without an accident and of course we ought to be investing in alternate energy sources recently there was a group of retired military officers who said that climate change and energy independence is a national security issue it is weve got to reduce our dependence on imported oil we can do it through a wide variety of alternative fuels but we have to be serious about it and were going to have to go to places where we have never gone before and nuclear power is one of the major issues but also all kinds of ethanol as well blitzer thank you senator let me bring congressman paul back into this conversation in 2005 president bush signed an energy bill that provided billions of dollars in tax break subsidies to the oil companies with the goal of boosting domestic production at a time of these record profits do you believe these companies need a helping hand from the federal government paul i dont think the profits is the issue the profits are ok if theyre legitimately earned in a free market what i object to are subsidies to big corporations when we subsidize them and give them rd money i dont think that should be that way they should take it out of the funds that they earn but also you cant discuss energy without discussing our foreign policy why do we go to the middle east we know the oil is very important about the middle east and why were there why did we our government help overthrow mosaddeq in 1953 it had to do with oil so our foreign policy is designed to protect our oil interests the profits thats not the problem its the problem that we succumb to the temptation to protect oil interests by literally going out and fighting wars over oil blitzer governor gilmore you agree gilmore i agree that if you make profits of the open marketplace that thats an appropriate thing to do i also believe that they should be going in and putting this additional money into additional drilling into additional exploration but its going to have to be bigger than that were going to have to in fact look to all sources ethanol biomass coal clean coal the opportunities for natural gas and nuclear power and by the way nuclear power will help this whole issue of global warming and one more point in direct answer to your question the kyoto treaty was in fact fatally flawed that was a treaty that in fact was going to basically just transfer our money directly to russia for nothing because they were going to get credits because simply that their economy had declined the truth is were going to have to get a program in place an international diplomatic answer that is going to include every nation of the world in this entire project and that includes china and india applause blitzer thank you governor let me bring scott back for the next question spradling congressman paul a question for you most of our closest allies including great britain and israel allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military is it time to end dont askdont tell policy and allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the us military paul i think the current policy is a decent policy and the problem that we have with dealing with this subject is we see people as groups as they belong to certain groups and that they derive their rights as belonging to groups we dont get our rights because were gays or women or minorities we get our rights from our creator as individuals so every individual should be treated the same way so if there is homosexual behavior in the military that is disruptive it should be dealt with but if theres heterosexual sexual behavior that is disruptive it should be dealt with so it isnt the issue of homosexuality its the concept and the understanding of individual rights if we understood that we would not be dealing with this very important problem applause blitzer governor huckabee i want you to weigh in as well do you believe its time to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the united states military huckabee wolf i think its already covered by the uniform code of military conduct i think thats what congressman paul was saying its about conduct its not about attitude but id like to ask you you said a moment ago that you were going to all give us a chance to deal with the issue of immigration blitzer were going to come back to that huckabee and i hope youll do that blitzer we will well come back to immigration huckabee you held us to it and now i want to hold you to it so blitzer were going to come back huckabee if you could give us that opportunity blitzer were going to come back to immigration but right now were talking about allowing gays to serve openly in the military but youre opposed to that huckabee i just said i think its a matter its not you dont punish people for their attitudes you punish them if their behavior creates a problem and its already covered by the uniform code of military conduct blitzer so you wouldnt change existing policy huckabee what blitzer you wouldnt change existing policy huckabee i dont think that i would i think its already covered by the existing policy that we do have in fact blitzer mayor giuliani recently weve learned that several talented trained linguists arabic speakers farsi speakers urdu speakers trained by the us government to learn those languages to help us in the war on terrorism were dismissed from the military because they announced they were gays or lesbians is that in your mind appropriate giuliani this is not the time to deal with disruptive issues like this back in 1994 we went through this and it created a tremendous amount of disruption colin powell i think was still the head of the joint chiefs of staff before he left at the beginning of the clinton administration he came to the view that this was a good policy and i think in time of war in a time where were trying to deal with this transition to a new kind of warfare that we have to be fighting and we havent gotten all the way there yet we need a hybrid army we need to look at nationbuilding as part of what we have to teach our military i dont think this would be the right time to raise these issues blitzer thank you giuliani and i think we should rely on the judgment of our commanders in a situation like this they know whats disruptive and whats not and at a time of war you dont make fundamental changes like this blitzer thank you mayor governor romney the mayor referred to the dont askdont tell policy which was implemented during the clinton administration after bill clinton became president in 1994 you were quoted as saying that you advocated gays being able to serve openly and honestly in our nations military the question to you is do you still feel that way romney no actually when i first heard of the dont askdont tell policy i thought it sounded awfully silly and didnt think thatd be very effective and i turned out to be wrong its been the policy now in the military for what 10 15 years and it seems to be working and i agree with what mayor giuliani said that this is not the time to put in place a major change a social experiment in the middle of a war going on i wouldnt change it at this point we can look at it down the road but it does seem to me that we have much bigger issues as a nation that we ought to be talking about than that policy right now blitzer senator mccain youve been involved in military matters virtually your whole life what do you say mccain we have the besttrained most professional best equipped most efficient most wonderful military in the history of this country and im proud of every one of them applause there just arent enough of them so i have to rely on our military leadership in whom we place the responsibility to lead these brave young americans in combat as we speak so i think it would be a terrific mistake to even reopen the issue it is working my friends the policy is working and i am convinced that thats the way we can maintain this greatest military as much as i revere the greatest generation as much as i love my own generation this is the very best lets not tamper with them blitzer is there anyone here who believes gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve openly in the united states military if you do speak up now scott go ahead with your question spradling gentlemen last night we asked democrats if they were elected what role would they use former president clinton im not going to ask you that laughter but governor thompson id like to know seeing as how you were a member of president bushs cabinet as health and human services secretary how would you use george w bush in your administration thompson i certainly would not send him to the united nations laughter i believe george w bush has tremendous characteristics hes very honest hes very straightforward i would put him out on a lecture series talking to the youth of america about honesty integrity perseverance passion and serving the public george w bush believes very much in public service as does his father as does his brothers as does his mother i think he could be a wonderful spokesperson making sure that young people realize that public service is a very noble cause and something that young people should aspire to like all the young people here on this campus should also have the opportunity to serve in public life applause blitzer senator brownback same question to you if youre elected president what would you ask your predecessor to do brownback well i would talk with him about it first and i would ask him about it i think he would probably take a position the way his dad did saying you know i think you need to have your time in the limelight and i will be willing to help out if you have a tragedy overseas his father has been excellent in the tsunami that hit sri lanka and other places in helping fundraising hes been a wonderful ambassador in those sorts of situations and frankly i think thats the right role for an expresident and i really think in many respects president clinton has not assumed the right role of an expresident where hes injected himself a lot more on policy issues that havent been appropriate and he really should defer more to the person thats in the job theres one person thats president at a time and thats the way it should be blitzer congressman tancredo i see you anxious to weigh in tancredo thank you some time ago in 2003 i think it was that i got a call from karl rove who told me that because of my criticism of the president i should never darken the doorstep of the white house i have been so disappointed in the president in so many ways since his actually for the last several years not just the immigration issue but several other things including the no child left behind and the massive increase in government that we call prescription drug medicare prescription drug that im afraid i would have to tell the president of the united states i mean as president i would have to tell george bush exactly the same thing karl rove told me blitzer thank you congressman governor huckabee applause you served as you reminded us a long time as a governor republican governor of arkansas your old job is now in democratic hands here in new hampshire the gop has suffered some significant losses as well and the republicans lost the majority in the house and the senate as you well know simple question whats happened to the gop huckabee lost credibility because we didnt do what we were hired to do when youre elected youre hired to do a job youre hired to cut spending lower taxes bring more government back to the local people we did the polar opposite and the people fired us and i think in many ways though there were some good people that got caught up in the tsunami of the 2006 elections the republican party as a whole deserved to get beat weve lost credibility the way we bungled katrina the fact that there was corruption that was unchecked in washington and the fact that there was a feeling that there was not a proper handling of the iraqi war in all of its details and the indifference to people pouring over our borders and let me just add this wolf there are a lot of people for whom the immigration issue is like a lot of them they see washington not taking the kind of positions to build a fence and they know that when they go to the airport to get on an airplane they have to show photo id they have to go through layers of security and they dont understand why someone across an international border doesnt have to do the same thing blitzer thank you thank you governor applause congressman hunter i want to just because he raised the issue he raised the issue of corruption do you think it would be appropriate for president bush to pardon lewis scooter libby who was sentenced today to 30 months in prison for his role in the cia leak case hunter you know i think wolf to make a determination on that youd have to look at the transcript ill tell you a couple of transcripts i have looked at and thats the agents compean and ramos who were given 11 and 12 years respectively for stopping a drug dealer bringing 750 pounds of drugs across the border ive looked at their transcript i would pardon compean and ramos right now applause and let me say with respect to what mike said weve got to bring back the reagan democrats to this party because we need the reagan democrats for republican leadership to work and were going to have to get a good trade bill that brings jobs back to this country were going to have to stop china from cheating on trade build the middle class build jobs wolf thats what strengthens the republican party applause blitzer i just want to do a quick yes or no and im going to go down the rest of the group and let everybody just tell me yes or no would you pardon scooter libby unknown no gilmore no im steeped in the law i wouldnt do that brownback no not without reading the transcript huckabee not without reading the transcript mccain hes going through an appeal process weve got to see what happens here giuliani i think the sentence was way out of line i mean the sentence was grossly excessive in a situation in which at the beginning the prosecutor knew who the leak was blitzer so yes or no would you pardon him giuliani and he knew a crime wasnt committed i recommended over a thousand pardons to president reagan when i was associate attorney general i would see if it fit the criteria for pardon id wait for the appeal i think what the judge did today argues more in favor of a pardon because blitzer thank you giuliani this is excessive punishment blitzer all right giuliani when you consider ive prosecuted 5000 cases blitzer im trying to get a yes or no laughter giuliani well this is a very important issue this is a very very important a mans life is at stake and the reality is this is an incomprehensible situation they knew who the leak was romney hey wolf can i explain giuliani and ultimately there was no underlying crime involved blitzer all right romney this is one of those situations where i go back to my record as governor i didnt pardon anybody as governor because i didnt want to overturn a jury but in this case you have a prosecutor who clearly abused prosecutorial discretion by going after somebody when he already knew that the source of the leak was richard armitage hed been told that so he went on a political vendetta blitzer was that a yes romney its worth looking at that i will study it very closely if im lucky enough to be president and id keep that option open blitzer senator brownback yes the basic crime here didnt happen what they were saying was that the identity of an agent blitzer all right governor brownback was revealed but that agent has to be in the field for that to be a crime that didnt occur blitzer governor thompson bill clinton committed perjury at a grand jury lost his law license scooter libby got 30 months to me its not fair at all but i would make sure the appeal was done properly and then i would examine the record blitzer congressman tancredo yes blitzer yes all right we heard from all of them applause were ready to take go into part two of tonights debate right now where voters from new hampshire will have an opportunity to ask their questions we have some work to do here on the stage while we move some chairs around move out the podiums while we do all that and youll be able to see it viewers of wmur are going to go back to their studios for the rest of you im going to bring in my colleagues larry king and anderson cooper part of the best political team on television to give us a sense of this debate so far our debate here will resume in about three minutes break blitzer were now set for our voters here to ask questions our pool of voters here are either registered republicans or independents but theyre likely likely to vote republican in new hampshires firstinthenation primary we brought them together with the help from the new hampshire political library and the new hampshire institute of politics cnn producers have interviewed all of them working with me in this half of the debate is jennifer vaughn from our partner wmurtv jennifer who has the first question jennifer vaughn wmurtv thank you wolf and good evening to you all tonight i have erin flanagan with me tonight hi erin question hi jennifer vaughn you live in bedford new hampshire question i do vaughn you have a question about the war in iraq which is something that is deeply personal to you question it is unfortunately my beloved little brother 1st lieutenant michael joseph cleary was killed in action in taji iraq eight days before he was to return home on december 20th of 2005 he was the best of the best and answered the call to serve our country my family has been devastated by the loss as a member of an american family who has suffered so greatly at the choices made by the current administration i desperately would like to know what you as commander in chief would do both in the halls of the american government to bring the parties together as well as on the desert sands of the middle east to bring this conflict to a point in which we can safely bring our troops home vaughn erin thank you congressman hunter lets begin with you on that hunter ok absolutely the key to leaving and incidentally thank you for his service and i want to let you know my son applause i want to let you know that my son duncan the day after 911 joined the marine corps quit his job did two tours in iraq hes in afghanistan right now first i want you to know that its worth it applause what he did was worth it and if we can achieve a country in iraq that will not be an state sponsor of terrorism for the next 5 to 10 to 20 years that will be a friend not an enemy of the united states and will have a modicum of freedom that is in the national interest of the united states just like establishing a free japan on the other side of the pacific was in our interest after world war ii just like providing freedom and a protective shield for salvador in central america was in our interest so what i would do and what we need to do right now and we are doing is standing up the iraqi army there is 129 battalions of iraqis that weve trained and equipped we need to start moving them into the combat zones where they displace the heavy american combat forces then we can pull our forces out we can bring them home or send them wherever uncle sam needs them again blitzer thank you hunter thats how we leave iraq the right way blitzer thank you congressman senator brownback id like you to weigh in brownback if i could and thank you for your familys service and what your brother did thats incredible and an incredible gift that he and your family have given us and i think youve identified the right thing its not about leaving and its not about being defeated its about getting the situation to a point that we can turn it over to iraqis and then us pull back from the front of the line thats why im putting forward tomorrow a bill and this would be about a threestate solution in iraq a kurdish state a sunni state a shia state with baghdad as the federal city in a loose weak federated system oil revenues equally divided and its a bipartisan bill we will have bipartisan support weve got to pull together here to win over there blitzer senator brownback and we can do this together but we havent put yet forward this administration a political solution that will be long term and durable blitzer thank you thank you senator brownback thats what weve got to do blitzer senator mccain is that a good idea to divide up iraq into three separate brownback its not divided its three states one country mccain its not maam i want to tell you thank you for your brothers service and sacrifice to our country we are proud of you and your endurance and were proud of your sacrifice this war im going to give you a little straight talk this war was very badly mismanaged for a long time and americans have made great sacrifices some of which were unnecessary because of this management of the war mismanagement of this conflict i believe we have a fine general i believe we have a strategy which can succeed so that the sacrifice of your brother would not be in vain that a whole 20 million or 30 million people would have a chance to live a free life in an open society and practice their religion no matter what those differences are and i believe that if we fail it will become a center of terrorism and we will ask more young americans to sacrifice as your brother did this is long and hard and tough but i think we can succeed and god bless you applause blitzer thank you senator jennifer go ahead with your next question vaughn cynthia kiernan is here with us tonight cynthia you live in merrimack new hampshire question yes vaughn you can go ahead and stand up and you brought your husband with you question yes michael served in iraq and we have a question regarding the government in iraq everyones talking about pull our troops out pull our troops out well considering theyve lived under a dictatorship for the last 30 years or so what are we going to do to make sure they have a government in place before we do pull our troops out and theyre able to help themselves otherwise were just putting them in a position to accept another terrorist leader applause vaughn congressman paul paul well weve had four years to do this and it hasnt worked the biggest incentive for them to take upon themselves the responsibility is just for us to leave paul we dont need to lose 100 men and women every month more than a thousand per year and so if you want it done you want them to take over youve got to give them an incentive so i think we should immediately stop patrolling the streets thats a policemans job its not the work of the army were not fighting a military battle were in a different type of warfare right now so the sooner we recognize that the sooner we can make sure that no more americans will die we have a lot of goodness in this country and we should promote it but never through the barrel of a gun we should do it by setting good standards motivating people and have them want to emulate us but you cant enforce our goodness like the necons preach with an armed force it doesnt work woodrow wilson was telling us about that in promoting democracy a long time ago blitzer thank you paul it doesnt work and we have to admit it blitzer thank you congressman applause let me bring mayor giuliani in i dont know if you consider yourself a neocon but go ahead and respond to what congressman paul said laughter giuliani michael thank you very much for serving us and thank your family for their tremendous sacrifice id like to put it in a slightly different context i believe that your service for us and your brothers sacrifice is one of the reasons were safe now in the united states i believe that this terrorist war began way back in the 1970s they attacked us in 1993 in new york they attacked us again in 2001 in a horrible way and i believe that what were doing in iraq if we can get it right is going to help reduce the risk for this country and if we get it wrong this is going to be much much worse for us and part of what we have to do and we havent done right is take on that responsibility of nationbuilding we created that responsibility for ourselves when we overthrew saddam hussein which we did very effectively it was one of the greatest military actions in american history overthrowing saddam hussein but we didnt accomplish the second step people can only embrace democracy when they have an orderly existence and we have to help provide that we didnt want that role but it is our role and we have to train our military to do it we should probably have an iraqstat program in which we measure how many people are going to school how many factories are open how many people are going back to work we had to get into the nittygritty of putting an orderly society together in iraq it is not too late to do it and id just like to ask id just like to ask one question i didnt get to ask before when you said if general petraeus comes back in september and reports that things arent going well what are we going to do but suppose general petraeus comes back in september and reports that things are going pretty well are we going to report that with the same amount of attention that we would report the negative news applause blitzer jennifer go ahead vaughn kysa crusco is here with us tonight hi kysa question hi vaughn you live in manchester new hampshire you are an attorney question i am vaughn ok whats your question tonight question my question is whether you believe that a conservative platform can also include a conservationist agenda and if so how vaughn governor gilmore gilmore the question was whether or not a conservative agenda can also have a conservation agenda and i think that it can certainly when i was governor of the state of virginia we worked very hard in order to make virginia a beautiful place and a place where we could in fact be welcoming to people and that it would be a nice community for people to visit but at the end of the day this is going to come down to the question of whether or not conservatism can match up with energy independence which is a national security issue and it is a fundamental part of conservatism conservatism means empowering people it means cutting taxes and controlling government spending it also means national security and national security means a lot of different elements right at this time and were discussing some of them tonight and i can assure the people who are families here tonight their young people young men and women who are on the battle lines and people who are committing their lives they are in fact serving the national interests of this country in a time of major crisis the other two issues however would also go to the issue of the immigration issue which i want to come back to at some point but also energy independence and energy independence also can serve the interests of conservation blitzer all right gilmore particularly if we use nuclear power and other clean forms of energy so that we can in fact make this a clean society that is also safe and secure for the nation blitzer thank you very much governor congressman tancredo do you believe true conservatives should be doing more to protect the environment tancredo yes i think that thats absolutely imperative and i think so because frankly youve got a conservative model to pick from i mean you know teddy roosevelt after all put this stamp on that the whole issue of conserving the environment creating the national parks system theres nothing anticonservative about doing anything like that and you know what else you can do in order to foster that you do it through conservative principles you make it profitable for people to do exactly that to put to make conservation an issue that hits people in the pocketbook or they can profit by getting involved in conservation thats one way the free market really works perfectly weve seen it happen all over the world we can see and we will put conservation to work conservation practices to work in the united states through conservative principles we have a lock on that blitzer thank you congressman jennifer go ahead vaughn good evening sir you are doug hall question yes vaughn i understand that youre the town moderator for chichester new hampshire question i am vaughn whats your question tonight question i know a business owner in northern new hampshire who was on vacation in spain last year for about three weeks while he was there he had to buy refills for prescription drugs brand name drugs and he discovered in buying those drugs that he could buy his refills there for 600 less than he could buy them here in new hampshire so since then he said he is going to take a trip over to spain and get his vacation paid for to buy his drugs my question to you is why is this and if you are elected president is there anything you would do to address it vaughn mayor giuliani giuliani what i would do is change the whole model that we have for health insurance in this country the problem with our health insurance is its government and employerdominated people dont make individual choices its your health you should own your health insurance we should be giving you a major tax deduction 15000 for a family so you can buy your own health insurance if you buy health insurance for 8000 or 9000 youll save 5000 or 6000 in tax free money then we should have a health savings account in which you can put some money aside to pay for your ordinary medical expenses health insurance should become like homeowners insurance or like car insurance you dont cover everything on your homeowners policy if you have a slight accident in your house if you need to refill your oil with your car you dont cover that with insurance but that is covered in many of the insurance policies because theyre governmentdominated and theyre employerdominated what the democrats suggested on this stage two nights ago was socialized medicine there was a man in california who said to me when we make health insurance free just wait and see how expensive it will become and the reality is that we need a free market we need 100 million americans making different decisions it will bring down the cost of health insurance it will bring down the cost of prescription medicines freemarket principles are the only things that reduce costs and improve quality socialized medicine will ruin medicine in the united states blitzer thank you mayor applause congressman hunter you live on the border san diego not far from mexico a lot of americans go to mexico to buy cheaper prescription drugs a lot of americans in this part of the country go to canada to buy cheaper prescription drugs what should we here in the united states be doing to bring down the price of prescription drugs hunter and wolf the fabulous grampy my fatherinlaw who lives with us is one of those people that trots down and goes through the border at yuma and does that so lots of americans do that but heres what happens eighty percent of the new drugs and new inventions that save our lives that help preserve the lives of the relatives of everyone whos in this particular room right now 80 percent of those inventions are made in the united states because we have free enterprise where people can go out invest and maybe they drill three dry holes in trying to produce a good drug that will save somebodys lives then maybe they hit the jackpot and they produce something that will save people and help their health they then recover their money in the united states and what they have left over in terms of market they put into the third world but third world countries like mexico could never provide the amount of money that it takes to make those inventions otherwise they would heres what we have to do we need to be able to buy our health care insurance across state lines wolf right now the same single policy that can be purchased in long beach for 73 costs 334 in new jersey the states lock up the insurance industry they wont let americans buy across state lines just like they do everything else if were able to do that blitzer thank you hunter were going to bring down the cost of health insurance blitzer thank you congressman jennifer lets go back to another question vaughn also on the topic of health care tonight this is a question from our wmurgathercom blogger who is joshua williamson joshua asks millions of americans are dissatisfied with the current state of our healthcare system and us employers are at a disadvantage due to the high cost of health insurance what would you do to fix the healthcare system and would you support implementing a singlepayer system in which the government acts as the insurer in order to save enough money to cover the millions of uninsured and to lower premiums for the rest of the us population governor thompson lets have you weigh in on that thompson you know ive been here for two debates we never had one question on health care thank that person for talking about health care number one we spend 2 trillion on health care thats 16 percent of the gross national product ninetythree percent of the cost of health care goes into waiting until after you become sick only 7 percent of the money is used to keep you well in the first place we got to completely transform the health care system make it a wellness system and make it a prevention system secondly we have 125 million americans that have one or more chronic illnesses in order to change this we have to educate the american people about tobacco about diabetes about cardiovascular and about obesity you do that youll be able to change health care the third thing 25 percent of americans use twothirds of the cost of health care if you manage those diseases you can reduce that down to 50 percent and save lots of money fourth information technology electronic medical record a patient bill of rights and be able to have eprescribing and if you do that youre going to be able to save billions of dollars if you just go paperless ladies and gentlemen you will save 10 percent of the cost of health care applause blitzer thank you governor very much governor romney you worked with the democrats in the state legislature in your home state the commonwealth of massachusetts you worked with ted kennedy to come up with a program that provides some mandates in effect the individual health insurance coverage some conservatives say this is simply big government more liberal involvement in peoples lives what do you say to those conservatives who are critical of the way you handled this issue in massachusetts romney well i want to talk to the people not just to those conservatives who are critical and the people of this country recognize theyve got some real concerns in health care and i learned after i was governor a short bit of time i talked to people and they say if i lose my job im going to lose my insurance and my insurance premiums are getting higher and higher and higher and i talked to smallbusiness people and they said i cant afford the policies anymore and we said you know weve got to find a way to get everybody insured and the last thing we want is to have the government take over health care because anything they take over gets worse not better were going to turn to washington because washington makes a mess washington is all talk and we said we need to find a way to get everybody in our state insured with private insurance the half a million who didnt have insurance all the people worried that if they lost their job theyd lose insurance we said weve got to find a way to get them insured without raising taxes without a government takeover and thats what we did it relies on personal responsibility this is a big issue for this country every democrat up there is talking about a form of socialized medicine government takeover massive tax increase we have to stand up and not just talk about it im the guy who actually tackled this issue we get all of our citizens insured we get people that were uninsured with private health insurance we have to stand up and say the market works personal responsibility works were going to have insurance for all of our citizens they can afford thats theirs thats portable they never have to worry about losing it thats the answer thank you blitzer thank you governor applause jennifer go ahead vaughn thank you wolf next question comes from you sir your name is max latona question yes it is vaughn you live in manchester new hampshire what do you do for a living sir question i teach philosophy here at saint anselm college vaughn and whats your question tonight question my question is a simple one in your opinion what is the most pressing moral issue facing this country today and if youre elected president how would you address that issue vaughn governor huckabee you are an ordained minister what is the most pressing moral issue in this country huckabee well it looks like im getting all the moral questions tonight and i guess thats a good thing laughter thats better than getting the immoral questions so im happy to get those laughter huckabee i really believe that if you define it a moral issue it is our respect our sanctity and our understanding of the value of every single human life because that is what makes america a unique place on this planet we value every life of an individual as if it represents the life of us all many of us who are prolife quite frankly i think have made the mistake of giving people the impression that prolife means we care intensely about people as long as that child is in the womb but beyond the gestation period weve not demonstrated as demonstrably as we should that we respect life at all levels not just during pregnancy we shouldnt allow a child to live under a bridge or in the backseat of a car we shouldnt be satisfied that elderly people are being abused and neglected in nursing homes it should never be acceptable to us that people are treated as expendable any people but the unique part of our country is that we elevate and we celebrate human life and if you look at us with a contrast to the islamic jihadists who would strap a bomb to the belly of their own child march him into a crowded room set the detonator and kill innocent people they celebrate death we celebrate life its the fundamental thing that makes us unique and it keeps us free i pray we never ever abandon that basic principle blitzer thank you governor applause blitzer mayor giuliani what is the most pressing moral issue in america today giuliani i think the governor is correct i would put it in maybe a slightly different way we have great gifts in this country that come to us from god we have a country in which we have freedom of religion freedom of press freedom for the individual the right to elect our own officials and the reality is that in some of the world much of the world that doesnt exist and i think the challenge for our generation is going to be are we able to share those gifts in an appropriate way with the rest of the world if we can bring along the middle east if we can bring along those countries that are presently our enemies and get them to see the values of these ideals if we have the moral strength to be able to explain it to them in the way ronald reagan was able to do with communism then we can end up having the peace that we want and we should not we should never become pessimistic about this remember this is the country that was at war with vietnam just a short while ago were friends now blitzer all right giuliani this was a country that was at war with japan italy and germany a generation ago theyre some of our best friends today we have great resources in this country and watching the strength of america when we believe in the essential ideals that we have theyre not just american ideals they come from god and i think its our moral obligation to find the right way to share that with the rest of the world blitzer thank you mayor applause congressman paul what is the most pressing moral issue in the united states right now paul i think it is the acceptance just recently that we now promote preemptive war i do not believe thats part of the american tradition we in the past have always declared war in defense of our liberties or go to aid somebody but now we have accepted the principle of preemptive war we have rejected the just war theory of christianity and now tonight we hear that were not even willing to remove from the table a preemptive nuclear strike against a country that has done no harm to us directly and is no threat to our national security i mean we have to come to our senses about this issue of war and preemption and go back to traditions and our constitution and defend our liberties and defend our rights but not to think that we can change the world by force of arms and to start wars applause blitzer thank you congressman senator brownback really wants to weigh in as well brownback thank you and thank you for the question from a philosopher i think its the life issue clearly and im prolife and im whole life and one of the things im the most the proudest about our party about is that weve stood for life weve been a party that has stood for a culture of life and it was in our platform in 1980 and it continues today and with that respect and i have respect for my other colleagues thats why i dont think we can nominate somebody thats not prolife in this party because it is at our core we believe that every life is beautiful is sacred is a child of a loving god from natural from conception to natural death and that applies not only here and in the womb it applies to somebody thats in poverty it applies to the child in darfur and that philosophy being prolife and whole life is something i think can really help move us forward as a country and as a party applause blitzer senator if rudy giuliani got the republican presidential nomination would you be able to support him brownback that question came up at the first debate and i stated that this is something that we as a party have struggled with i have great respect for the mayor i dont think were going to nominate somebody thats not prolife blitzer would you be able to support him brownback i can support and will support the nominee of our party but our party has stood on principles its a party of principles its not a party of personalities we lose when we walk away from our principles thats when we have trouble and thats the country wants us to do blitzer thank you senator brownback is to stand for principles applause blitzer jennifer go ahead vaughn next question tonight from neil capano neil you are an airline agent question yes i am vaughn you live in manchester new hampshire you have a question tonight for governor romney question yes i do first of all i would like to thank all of you for joining us tonight in beautiful manchester new hampshire however my question is for governor romney exclusively youve been accused of youve been

films is in the script and boy did it deliver charles pulled out this whopper midway through the movie saying toronto is fine because mothers on the currency there and if that isnt proof then i dont know what is need more harry gives a bracelet to meghan that matches his and says so when i see you on instagram and you see me in tatler well know were thinking of each other step aside shakespeare here i run through the 10 very strong opinions i had about the shit that went down in harry meghan the royal love story 1 this movie rips the shit out of kate and wills relationship obviously harrys big brother and sisterinlaw feature in this lifetime film so i wasnt shocked when their plummy little faces popped up but what i was taken aback by was how nasty their edit was the couple was made out to be bitchy stuck up and rather unhappy in their marriage there was also some hella awkward exchanges between the two of them with kate explaining that its fine to settle with marriage before prodding wills and saying marriage is fine right before a bloody awkward silence 2 kate middleton is a bitch kate was portrayed as the bitchy highschooler who just happened to be notsolowkey racist too in a chat with william charles and harry she plainly says shes american shes divorced shes black enunciating it like it was pure torture coming out of her mouth she also is besties in the movie with the palace arsehole bella she claims that she has good insight and taught her how to survive in this royal world but really they just seemed like bitchy mates who sat around drinking martinis and slagging off anyone and everyone powered by giphy kate does get a little better by the end somewhat bonding with meghan and accepting her as a new addition to the fam stating us commoners have to stick together in worlds poshest accent 3 prince george and princess charlotte are american this was one heck of a surprise when cherub cheeked george and adorably shy charlotte arrived in the movie i thought i was going to get a weird parallel universeinsight into what the real deal royal kids are like however what i actually got was a yanky kid pretending to be a brit it was weird 4 i now have my new favourite innuendo during a chat between will and kate about the new royal couple will coined the phrase he botswanaed her which was for sure royal chatter for rumpydepumpy powered by giphy despite the plumminess of it all this now my new favourite phrase and i will use it in as many scenerio as physically possible how did gregs date go oh he only went and bloody botswanaed her did you pass the exam mate i didnt just pass i botswanaed that bugger big night let me tell you i was absolutely botswanaed 5 harry and meghan had very different requirements going in to their relationship when their mutual friend violet was trying to matchmake both harry and meghan had their personal priorities for their first date meghan said to violet i only want to know one thing is he nice and harry said to violet all i need to know is she hot luckily violet had a wittyish comeback saying to the cheeky prince lets just say if you werent a prince you wouldnt have a shot powered by giphy 6 prince harry and meghan markle went to a party in toronto dressed as hilary clinton and a frog this is honestly just a sentence that im really happy is in my life now 7 harry and meghan maybe definitely possibly had a face off with a lion during their second trip to botswana in the movie the couple have a bit of a fight after harry refuses to open up to meghan about dianas death and harry storms off into the wild african plains with meghan running after him they stop in their tracks when they see an actual lion waltzing towards them the two freeze and just stare at this lion praying that their semivaluable selves dont get ripped to shreds by simba powered by giphy im pretty sure this didnt happen irl making this an even weirder scene in this already quite odd movie 8 harry had a bitchfest about diana this scene was almost as unexpected as the lion one because harry repped in the media for having a huge amount of respect for his mum and missing her like crazy went to town about how shit she was in the film he said that she was difficult and sad and that she put on her heroic charitable bestself for the cameras but that she was really an attention seeking looneytoon he even referenced her walk through a minefield in africa as a prstunt claiming that she said she was probably the safest person in africa at that very moment being a bit of a di fan i was cheesed off that the film took this angle back off from the princess of the people bitch powered by giphy 9 harry actually proposed in botswana when i say actually i mean actually in the movie which is now my trusty source for all things hazza and megs they framed it as a proposal in bed after the fightdianalionmakeupsexscene which kinda sucked the romance out of it a little because it seemed a tad too reactive like id still say yes if prince harry popped the question to me in that way but id also tell our grandchildren a fake but better proposal story 10 okay i cried during the chicken proposal scene the story that we all know from irl harry and meghans engagement interview is that harry got down on one knee while they were roasting a chicken at home so i was hardkey hoping that we still got to see this proposal it was riiiiiight at the end of the movie spoiler alert and boy was it cute though to be honest i was emotionally on the brink because rom coms have a tendency to destroy me so the second i saw the chicken i started to sob absolutely no idea what harry said in his proposal because i was crying too aggressively but i can imagine it was probably pretty eloquentromanticadorableany other descriptive word that would describe a ginger prince
politifact14944,0,who is affected by the government shutdown thousands of government workers are unsure whether or not they will be heading to work on monday amid uncertainty about how long a government shutdown will last uncertainty is the byproduct of a government shutdown with its impact often hard to predict however clues exist in the last shutdown which was in 2013 key services will continue and many agencies plan to use carryover funds to remain open for several days but each day the shutdown lasts adds to the pressure on agencies government employees and civilian contractors as well as americans who rely on various federal services employees considered essential will still be required to report to work should the shutdown continue while those in positions deemed nonessential will be barred from coming in the white house on friday pledged to minimize the effects of the shutdown on the american people with one official noting that the administration has urged government agencies to do as much as they can within the law to maintain operations the push for departments and agencies to utilize existing funding to remain open suggests the trump administration is hedging its bets that lawmakers can reach a deal and avoid a shutdown the length of one in 2013 which lasted 16 days each federal agency has a contingency plan for a shutdown that is written with help from the white houses office of management and budget but the impact of the shutdown which began at midnight when the senate failed to pass a shortterm spending bill is likely to trickle down gradually as agencies work to mitigate the effects about half of the department of health and human services will be placed on furlough beneficiaries of programs like medicare social security and medicaid will still receive services the food and drug administration however will take a hit as it will have to halt activities like food safety inspections the centers for disease control and prevention will

saturday at a press conference the environmental protection agency will largely stay open during the governments closure and the labor department will resume mine safety inspections military personnel

transportation security administration tsa personnel will continue operations meaning travelers will see both tsa employees and canines operating in airports the federal aviation administrations faa management of air traffic control will also continue flight delays are not expected and much of the faas safety inspections will continue the government closure a result of congresss failed negotiations over a spending bill the last several weeks has sparked both intraparty battles and fights between democrats and republicans the two parties have each tried to cast blame on the other for the shutdown with the republican national committee invoking the hashtag schumershutdown referring to senate minority leader charles schumer charles chuck ellis schumerdemocrats will need to explain

newsvine advertisement edmund d fountain times mike hughes of largo pam wilson of indian rocks beach and nora harvey of dunedin sit outside the renaissance vinoy resort in st petersburg protesting sen john mccains fundraiser there wednesday about 50 people including democrats and union members came out against the presumptive republican nominee for president whom they called mcsame as president bush wilson made signs for the protest jack ganzell of dunedin far right says he came out because he wanted to see what was going on related links audio excerpts of mccains interview with the times adam smith st petersburg charlie crist may not yet have a full gubernatorial term under his belt but sen john mccain said wednesday crist has enough experience to be vice president oh i am sure that in many respects charlie crist is qualified hes had other offices as we know he was attorney general as well this is a big and diverse state mccain said in an interview wednesday evening before a 1000perperson private fundraising reception but we havent moved anywhere on the process that he would be under the presumptive republican presidential nominee stressed we have a large number of people that we are considering but i just dont mention anybodys name because then it starts a process that could end up in an invasion of their privacy in a taped interview to air sunday on political connections on bay news 9 mccain said he will reach out to supporters of sen hillary rodham clinton and noted his independence from president bush on such issues as government spending and climate control i promise them that ill be the president of all the people not just republicans or anybody else but all the people mccain said i realize that i have to get independents and democrats if im going to win this election he also decried the giant confederate flag thats been proposed to fly near the intersection of interstates 4 and 75 in hillsborough county mccain has faced this issue before and has voiced profound regret for not taking a stand against a rebel flag atop the south carolina statehouse during the 2000 gop primary its a free country mccain said of the flag in hillsborough but he said the civil war memorial group behind the flag plans should consider the feelings and sensitivities on this issue at a time like this in america where we want to move forward now that the democratic nominee has been chosen mccain knows he faces an opponent in sen barack obama who is more inspiring and energetic on the stump mccain isnt worried i think people are very interested in substance as well as style he said mccain also struck on a theme of his campaign suggesting obama lacks the experience and knowledge to be president but polls show a strong majority of american voters think invading iraq was a mistake which is what obama said all along when asked if obama showed better judgment in opposing the invasion mccain defended the war as the right call because every intelligence agency in the world believed that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction what about floridas bob graham the former senate intelligence committee chairman who argued at the time that invading iraq would divert attention and resources from more urgent threats particularly alqaida i respect sen graham enormously but i dont think theres any doubt that saddam hussein who had acquired and used weapons of mass destruction before had invaded a neighbor kuwait where we had to fight one war with him that his intent was to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction mccain replied the private fundraising reception at the renaissance vinoy resort in st petersburg kicked off a threeday florida swing which includes a speech to newspaper editors in orlando today and an event touting his environmental credentials in the everglades on friday obama campaign spokesman bill burton dismissed mccains efforts to cast himself as anything but a continuation of president bushs agenda while john mccain has a record of occasional independence from his party in the past last year he chose to embrace 95 percent of george bushs agenda including his failed economic policies and his failed policy in iraq burton said referring to mccains voting record no matter how hard he tries to spin it otherwise that kind of record is simply not the change the american people are looking for or deserve mccain said he supports the antigay marriage ballot initiatives in florida and california even though the republican governors of both states have little interest in those efforts while he voted against a federal marriage amendment proposal mccain noted that he supported a similar initiative in his home state of arizona where voters rejected the idea i think its important to preserve the unique status of a marriage between men and women mccain said i respect the views of others who dont hold that view but i also think that we have a process in our states to amend our constitutions

well i know who im not voting for if he does chose charlie you know every king needs a court jester by fj jun 5 2008 1152 am if bush can be a president when he cant even read why cant crist be a vice president lets face it our standards have been lowerd by bush apparently a trained monkey can be president by c jun 5 2008 1152 am so fairlynew gov crist has experience to be one step away from the

never vote for obama but if mccain pick crist i will have not choice i will have to throw mccain under the bus by pete jun 5 2008 1152 am good maybe we can get him out of the governors seat then hes been dangerous to floridians in that role since day 1 by billy jun 5 2008 1152 am at least bush had ideas bush had terrible ideas and look at the results of his ideas and his gut reactions i am not a republican but i must say that crist is far more intelligent and acceptable than bush by kitty jun 5 2008 1052 am another reason to not vote for ya thanks for the warning johnny boy by zander jun 5 2008 1052 am are you kidding me charlie crist seems like a nice guy but he is no more qualified to be vp than obama is qualified to be president by jh jun 5 2008 1052 am graham said we should be focusing on iran not iraq and thats why he voted against going to iraq al qaedas zawahiri stated that iraq was the central front in the war against the west its time the far left admitted defeat we are winning in iraq by ted jun 5 2008 1051 am after watching both mccains and obamas speeches on tv tuesday night mccain no less than needs to run alaska gov sarah palin as his vp mate by marie jun 5 2008 1051 am god help us rinos by clifford jun 5 2008 1051 am charlie doesnt pass the white picket fence test he isnt married has no children and doesnt own property unless you consider the child that the mother says is charlies but cc wont submit to a dna test charlie is also dating a married woman by cindi jun 5 2008 1051 am if mccain picks charlie crist for vp this demonstrates an incredible lack of knowledge crist does nothing unless he knows that it will not decrease his popularitywhat has he done as gov nothing i have never voted for him and wont in november by bill jun 5 2008 1051 am please take empty chair charlie with you hes done nothing to help with any of the real florida issues at least bush had ideascrist has none by peggy jun 5 2008 1051 am mccain was promoted by crists tactic to endorse him crist did this knowing personally from guiliani that guilliani was throwing all his eggs into florida primary fightfor crists short list pick he destroyed the younger more vibrant candidate by joshu jones jun 5 2008 1050 am saddam hussein who had acquired and used weapons of mass destruction before that his intent was to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction so the us just doesnt supply him with any more problem solved by debbie jun 5 2008 1050 am and there you have it folks signs of dementia already crist is no more qualified to be vice president than obama is to be president what poor choices we have all because the process is tainted by money by holly jun 5 2008 1050 am as we all know there are two sides to every polician unfortunately george bush has soured so many people that we are too eager for change has obama ever had a real job i know he doesnt speak to my personal every day needs by tranottoc jun 5 2008 1050 am it would be a shame for

politifact15210,0,breaking trump just ended welfare for one huge group for 5 years let the riots erupt 318 shares share tweet president trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the american welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years the immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free american welfare money right away it will slow down or stop chain migration while protecting american workers and potentially saving taxpayers moneywhat used to happen is that people would migrate to america and just live on the free money they received thats called welfare abuse america is open to migrants but perhaps we dont want migrants who cant fend for themselves maybe its better if people who are selfsufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the systempresident trump wants to introduce a meritbased green card system in which migrants compete for visas migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak english gaining job training or job offers or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the america the idea seems to be that in order for america to grant visas or citizenship the migrant has to give something back to the country its as though the government wants to stop people coming to america and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors do something for america and america will do something for youmigrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for english proficiency competitive training a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host countrythe concept which is modeled after similar programs from australia and canada is taking harsh criticism from activists its like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money but that would just be the downfall of america if we observe whats happening in germany with merkels come on in policy then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in america theres already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on american people and even other immigrantsif america prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years then that makes people think twice about coming here if a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free then they may not come at all if they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society then thats a great match america is the land of the free but not the land of the free moneymigrants who enter the united states cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country president trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhauljust this week we announced a historic immigration bill to create a meritbased green card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system stops chain migration and protects our workers and our economy he stated on his weekly radio address as an example you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our countryyou cannot just come in like in past weeks years and decades you come in immediately and start picking up welfare for five years you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systemscompare that to germany where chancellor angela merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who cant speak german and lack employable skills which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by german taxpayers and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against once again german taxpayerslast year the german government admitted that only 28 of over 12 million migrants had gotten a job but even then those statistics might be exaggerated according to journalist chris menahanthey said back in july only 55 out of one million migrants had got jobs with any major firms and 50 of those jobs were working at the post office he reported twothirds or more of these migrants are illiterate in their own languagesthey came because merkel promised them free money if they can just make it into the countrywhat in tarnation would be a good reason for any country to accept illiterate people who dont work there is literally no benefit to the host country to admit people like that i know it sounds mean to say this but they dont offer anything to the country other than leeching the system of funds and its a complete downgrade to the population if you let too many low illiterate people into the country then they have kids who could be illiterate then over time it would only decrease the overall intelligence of the country and civilization in america would suffer we need hard working and intelligent people who bring promise and productivity to further the advancement of americans and mankind that sounds like quite a stretch but think of the impact of accepting one million people who mostly cant read or dont worknow the government has to pay for themlets say one million immigrants each get 30000 worth of welfare benefits per year thats 30000000000 of free welfare money sucked out of the american budget for people who put nothing back into our society culture or anything at all that is literally a 000 return on investment not that people are a business but thats really bad business and as you can see germany has turned into a cesspool from all the migrants flooding the gates and ruining their nationprepare for a massive backlash from liberals democrats and activists

or not i find that study incredibly irritating happily there are other studies that tell us the real truth about the health benefits of marriage which is that the benefits have nothing to do with marriage at all because those studies have shown that staying in an unhappy marriage is the worst thing you can do for your health and your children so better health is a direct result of healthy relationships you dont need a spouse you just need someone you can trust you need someone you can talk to you need someone who will celebrate your wins and grieve your losses you need someone who can

furious franchise if johnson was in he later claimed he was never mad at johnson though continued to slam him so the rock how does it feel bro going home to your daughter every night he asked referencing his highly publicized custody battle over daughter shayla it was 60 days before i seen my baby and all i asked you to do privately was not accept a role that would deeply affect us all you are simply not the peoples champ you are a selfish champ 3 kanye west vs jayz getty images the two close friends and collaborators falling out continued this year after west publicly called jayz out during an onstage concert rant last november you got hurt because this guy was talking about you on a stage jayz commented in august during an interview with elliott wilson and brian bdot miller on the rap radar podcast but what really hurt me you cant bring my kid or my wife into it like kanye is my little brother hes talked about me a hundred times he even made a song called big brother weve gotten past bigger issues but you brought my family into it now its a problem in july west reportedly left jayzs tidal over a money dispute however there is hope for those wishing for a watch the throne part two during a qa with new york times executive editor dean baquet for t the new york times style magazine in november jayz had a few conciliatory words for west whom he still referred to as his brother i talked to kanye the other day just to tell him like hes my brother he recalled i love kanye i do its a complicated relationship with us still jayz admitted that theres currently tension between the two but that happens he stressed in the long relationship you know hopefully when were 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that theres gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through and the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say these are the things that im uncomfortable with these are the things that are unacceptable to me this is what i feel im sure he feels that ive done things to him as well im not a perfect human being by no stretch west is a very compassionate person he added and a lot of times he get in trouble trying to help others so i can identify with it its just that theres certain things that happened thats not really acceptable to me and we just need to speak about it but theres genuine love there 4 camila cabello vs fifth harmony getty images things turned messy between girl group fifth harmony and camila cabello pretty quickly after she announced she was leaving the group last december and the remaining members lauren jauregui ally brooke normani kordei and dinah jane claimed in a statement that they only learned of her departure through her representatives in an interview with billboard in february cabello talked about the intense split and admitted she hadnt spoken to her former bandmates i was always super open that i couldnt just sing other peoples words and be totally happy with that cabello said of exiting the group you have to follow and honor that inner voice i always encouraged the girls to do the same i dont want to get into the details of that because it was really intense and its hard for me to talk about she added about not keeping in touch it makes me sad in their own billboard interview in july fifth harmony wasnt shy about alluding to the bad blood lets just say were in a better place now there are no secrets in this circle jane said of cabellos exit however the shadiest moment definitely happened at the mtv video music awards in august when before their performance of angel and down a a fifth member of the group presumably meant to represent cabello fell backwards off the stage the group later denied they were slamming cabello during an interview with good morning america we get asked all the time if were getting a fifth member brooke explained and we wanted to show the world in an artistic way that hey the four of us are fifth harmony we are stronger and better than weve ever been 5 kim cattrall vs sex and the city cast new line cinema rumors have floated around for some time now that kim cattrall didnt get along with her sex and the city cast members and they were pretty much confirmed this year after sarah jessica parker announced that there would be no sex and the city 3 film its over were not doing it she told extra im disappointed we had this beautiful funny heartbreaking joyful very relatable script and story its not just disappointing that we dont get to tell the story and have that experience but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie the daily mail later reported that it was cattralls demands that put a stop to the project claiming she insisted that warner bros produce other movies she had in development before signing onto satc 3 cattrall denied the report on twitter cattrall then specifically called out parker during an interview with piers morgan for itvs life stories at this very moment its quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that ive been saying for almost a year she noted this is really where i take to task the people from sex and the city specifically sarah jessica parker in that i think she could have been nicer she expressed to morgan i really think she could have been nicer i dont know what her issue is i never have she added cattrall also said she was never friends with her satc costars including cynthia nixon and kristin davis weve been colleagues and in some ways its a very healthy place to be because then you have a clear line between your professional life and relationship and your personal she noted they all have children and i am 10 years older and since specifically the series ended i have been spending most of my time outside of new york so i dont see them the common ground that we had was the series and the series is over though she did admit that she wishes her costars would try harder to keep in touch after sharing that she couldnt even recall the last time she had spoken to them thats another thing thats really disappointing is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say how you doing she shared and it appears the cast is taking sides willie garson who portrayed stanford blatch the best friend of carrie bradshaw parker in both the tv series and the movies posted a cryptic tweet in october that appeared to be aimed at cattrall cattrall repeatedly denied that she ever considered doing a third satc movie and further claimed that she never began contract negotiations dear fans because im toxic im going to negotiate a contract for 6 months not come to terms then say i never wanted to do it anyway he wrote 6

are simply not the peoples champ you are a selfish champ 3 kanye west vs jayz getty images the two close friends and collaborators falling out continued this year after west publicly called jayz out during an onstage concert rant last november you got hurt because this guy was talking about you on a stage jayz commented in august during an interview with elliott wilson and brian bdot miller on the rap radar podcast but what really hurt me you cant bring my kid or my wife into it like kanye is my little brother hes talked about me a hundred times he even made a song called big brother weve gotten past bigger issues but you brought my family into it now its a problem in july west reportedly left jayzs tidal over a money dispute however there is hope for those wishing for a watch the throne part two during a qa with new york times executive editor dean baquet for t the new york times style magazine in november jayz had a few conciliatory words for west whom he still referred to as his brother i talked to kanye the other day just to tell him like hes my brother he recalled i love kanye i do its a complicated relationship with us still jayz admitted that theres currently tension between the two but that happens he stressed in the long relationship you know hopefully when were 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that theres gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through and the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say these are the things that im uncomfortable with these are the things that are unacceptable to me this is what i feel im sure he feels that ive done things to him as well im not a perfect human being by no stretch west is a very compassionate person he added and a lot of times he get in trouble trying to help others so i can identify with it its just that theres certain things that happened thats not really acceptable to me and we just need to speak about it but theres genuine love there 4 camila cabello vs fifth harmony getty images things turned messy between girl group fifth harmony and camila cabello pretty quickly after she announced she was leaving the group last december and the remaining members lauren jauregui ally brooke normani kordei and dinah jane claimed in a statement that they only learned of her departure through her representatives in an interview with billboard in february cabello talked about the intense split and admitted she hadnt spoken to her former bandmates i was always super open that i couldnt just sing other peoples words and be totally happy with that cabello said of exiting the group you have to follow and honor that inner voice i always encouraged the girls to do the same i dont want to get into the details of that because it was really intense and its hard for me to talk about she added about not keeping in touch it makes me sad in their own billboard interview in july fifth harmony wasnt shy about alluding to the bad blood lets just say were in a better place now there are no secrets in this circle jane said of cabellos exit however the shadiest moment definitely happened at the mtv video music awards in august when before their performance of angel and down a a fifth member of the group presumably meant to represent cabello fell backwards off the stage the group later denied they were slamming cabello during an interview with good morning america we get asked all the time if were getting a fifth member brooke explained and we wanted to show the world in an artistic way that hey the four of us are fifth harmony we are stronger and better than weve ever been 5 kim cattrall vs sex and the city cast new line cinema rumors have floated around for some time now that kim cattrall didnt get along with her sex and the city cast members and they were pretty much confirmed this year after sarah jessica parker announced that there would be no sex and the city 3 film its over were not doing it she told extra im disappointed we had this beautiful funny heartbreaking joyful very relatable script and story its not just disappointing that we dont get to tell the story and have that experience but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie the daily mail later reported that it was cattralls demands that put a stop to the project claiming she insisted that warner bros produce other movies she had in development before signing onto satc 3 cattrall denied the report on twitter cattrall then specifically called out parker during an interview with piers morgan for itvs life stories at this very moment its quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that ive been saying for almost a year she noted this is really where i take to task the people from sex and the city specifically sarah jessica parker in that i think she could have been nicer she expressed to morgan i really think she could have been nicer i dont know what her issue is i never have she added cattrall also said she was never friends with her satc costars including cynthia nixon and kristin davis weve been colleagues and in some ways its a very healthy place to be because then you have a clear line between your professional life and relationship and your personal she noted they all have children and i am 10 years older and since specifically the series ended i have been spending most of my time outside of new york so i dont see them the common ground that we had was the series and the series is over though she did admit that she wishes her costars would try harder to keep in touch after sharing that she couldnt even recall the last time she had spoken to them thats another thing thats really disappointing is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say how you doing she shared and it appears the cast is taking sides willie garson who portrayed stanford blatch the best friend of carrie bradshaw parker in both the tv series and the movies posted a cryptic tweet in october that appeared to be aimed at cattrall cattrall repeatedly denied that she ever considered doing a third satc movie and further claimed that she never began contract negotiations dear fans because im toxic im going to negotiate a contract for 6 months not come to terms then say i never wanted to do it anyway he wrote 6 katy perry vs taylor swift getty images the epic katy perry vs taylor swift feud continued with the promotion of both their respective albums this year perrys witness and swifts reputation perry didnt

wish that i could turn the other cheek every single time but im also not a pushover you know especially when someone tries to assassinate my character with little girls her fans thats so messed up though swift stayed silent on perrys comments about her she let her actions do the talking swift surprisingly announced on june 8 that her entire catalog will return to all streaming services at midnight just when perrys witness dropped swift also took thinly veiled digs at perry in her look what you made me do music video that dropped in august swift dresses up very similar to perry in the shadefilled video and gets into a car crash a moment that looks very close to the accident in perrys unconditionally music video she also pointedly holds a grammy highlighting that she has 10 accolades while perry has zero later swift is in a vault robbing a bank and wearing a sweatshirt that features a glittery tiger along with a cat mask seemingly mocking the name of perrys fanbase

gossipcop-7485333505,0,danny boyles exit from james bond throws franchise into chaos the immediate future of the james bond franchise is in chaos after the sudden departure of the director danny boyle three months before shooting on the asyetuntitled film was scheduled to start the oscarwinning filmmaker behind slumdog millionaire and trainspotting quit leaving producers scrambling a delay to the scheduled release date of 25 october 2019 looks inevitable there is also speculation the fallout could stretch further claiming star daniel craig as another victim a tweet from the franchises official account announced on monday evening michael g wilson barbara broccoli and daniel craig today announced that due to creative differences danny boyle has decided to no longer direct bond 25 industry insiders suspect these differences revolve around the script which boyle wrote with his longterm collaborator john hodge the pair previously collaborated on trainspotting and its sequel as well as the beach a life less ordinary and boyles debut shallow grave the bond script was reportedly a dealbreaker for boyle who took on the project after the departure of sam mendes who directed skyfall in 2012 before returning having previously quit for 2015s spectre view image in fullscreen daniel craig in the most recent james bond film spectre photograph allstarunited artists the producers were reportedly so keen to secure boyle that they put an already completed screenplay by the longtime 007 writers neal purvis and robert wade on the backburner purvis and wade have previously written six bond films including all four craig outings as well as the final two starring his predecessor pierce brosnan hodge and boyles script which is different in all respects was thought to have been a workinprogress until recently and it is understood its themes were more topical than is traditional for a bond film a leaked castingcall sheet indicated that the key villain would be russian and boyle has suggested the film would help the franchise evolve in the metoo and timesup era you write in real time he said you acknowledge the legacy of the world of bond and you write in the world but you also write in the modern world as well boyle indicated that the script featured a considerable coup de cinema its a great idea so hopefully it will work which some speculated could involve a highconcept plot in which bond would be incarcerated for much of the running time or potentially die the highstakes nature of such a twist and the controversial reallife issues the film may have explored may well have proved a sticking point with producers bond films have increasingly toyed with topicality with spectre hanging on an initiative to axe field agents in favour of virtual espionage however grappling with issues such as sexual assault and russian influence in geopolitics might have been deemed too great a gamble although mendes and craigs tenure has put bond back in favour with liberal critics as well as punters eon productions the production company behind the franchise would be unlikely to want to risk the alienation of a large part of its target market to placate talent with budgets for skyfall and spectre exceeding 300m 232m little compromise for the films commercial prospects can be countenanced boyle and hodges script is unlikely to survive the directors exit meaning that purvis and wades draft will need to be polished up for production and the entire enterprise overhauled to account for a different story characters and settings this would add at least a year to the schedule and the film may not be released until late2020 at the earliest producers would be reluctant to delay further as a 2020 release date would already mean a fiveyear gap between the new film and spectre although there were four years between craigs second outing quantum of solace 2008 and his third skyfall 2012 the longest break between bond films is only six years between licence to kill 1989 and goldeneye 1995 and that involved a change of actor in the leading role this makes it yet more likely that craig 50 will call it a day until there was confirmation he would return alongside boyle speculation had been rife that the actor a famously reluctant tuxedo wearer would move on with idris elba and tom hardy among those named as possible candidates to replace him promoting spectre in 2015 craig said he would rather slash his wrists than reprise the role months later his departure seemed all but certain following that of mendes in 2016 craig was reportedly offered 150m to star in another two bond movies by broccoli and this year he was confirmed for at least one more craig and boyle have worked together once before when the former appeared as bond alongside the queen in a brief film that featured in the london 2012 olympic opening ceremony which boyle directed mark tildesley boyles favoured production designer was also recruited to the bond film this year his future on the project is now unknown boyles latest film a romcom scripted by richard curtis is scheduled for release in september 2019 just a month before the bond movie was due to come out it is distributed by universal pictures which recently took on uk distribution rights to the bond films from sony pictures which was responsible for getting boyles most recent big screen release t2 trainspotting into cinemas possible replacements for boyle include christopher nolan christopher mcquarrie and susanne bier mcquarries latest film mission impossible fallout was widely praised for its bondstyle plot and stunts the film which stars tom cruise has so far made 500m at the box office

gossipcop-1558798692,0,how to perform a satanic destruction ritual how to perform a satanic destruction ritual ali kellog follow 9 min read dec 31 2017 12 listen share photo by levan tk la weekly ive come to learn that rituals are treated very similarly to masturbation in society its something everyone does whether they like to admit it or not were told to be ashamed of their practice but they both make us feel good rituals are a very personal thing and seldom understood writ large if youre out with people and you tell them you did a ritual earlier that day odds are youll be met with the same response as if you told them you jerked off that morning what are rituals the truth is that all of human life is made of rituals mere mention of the word generally conjures images of occult symbols painted on the walls of decrepit basements animal sacrifice and strange chanting that reverberates off the walls of horror film scenery and news headlines to assault the american imagination however rituals are a universal feature of human cognitive function and social structure its time we reevaluate what the meaning of a ritual is and recognize the potential dare i say benefits of doing such things specifically here the destruction ritual rituals have a strange role in my life coming from an academic background in anthropology the anthropological definition is engrained in my mind the formal definition in that field is rituals are actions with intentional symbolic meaning undertaken for a specific cultural purpose such as a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood and may reinforce broader community social bonds as in a wedding they are used to reinforce social bonds and structure traditional oriya wedding ceremony in india is a rightofpassage ritual practiced by those of the hindu faith to ceremonialize the union between two people communion is a christian ritual in which bread and wine are consumed to symbolically represent the body and blood of christ being consummated and taken into his worshippers new years eve ritual practiced by americans in new york every year on january 31st at midnight in which a giant ball is dropped from the top of time square and confetti is released to celebrate the arrival of another year im also a chapter head for the satanic temple so writing and performing rituals has become a foundational and therapeutic practice for me for the last few years ive found myself straddling a line between scientific objectivism and emotional catharsis with the subject rituals are repeated human actions to fulfill reinforce and maintain a part of the human function and experience brushing our teeth is a ritual created to tend to our dental health breakfast lunch and dinner are daily rituals to tend to our caloric intake prayer before bed meals or at church every sunday is a ritual to tend to piety and relationship with god going to the gym is a ritual to tend to maintenance of our muscular and cardiovascular systems but why dont gym bags toothbrushes and eggo waffles send people running for the hills the mediadriven manson case heavily polluted the concept of rituals in america the media has heavily slandered the practice of rituals the taboo has gone so far in the us as to compelling hundreds of police departments nationally to create specific manuals for identifying satanic rituals and effectively busting anyone caught doing them this has had devastating side effects on our society see the satanic panic of the 1980s 1990s countless people who simply didnt fit the mold of their community have been falsely accused of and imprisoned for horrible crimes ranging from rape to murder what is the satanic temple the satanic temple is a religious and activist organization that was birthed from the idea that we are at a point in history where combating the status quo is an essential component of progression as individuals and as a society in our view satan is a mascot for combating bigotry and detrimental authority we see god and satan as literary figures that have become so deeply engrained in our culture that much of our public policy and legislation is based upon their story in the infamous revolt of the angels satan lets refer to him as lucifer the angel as he is called in the new testament was of the angels created by god said to be the most perfect powerful and intelligent god essentially created these angels to be hit men immediately sending them off on quests to murder people who challenged him lucifer identified this problem rallied some of the other angels and confronted god to challenge his authority most any christian you talk to will see this as lucifer being arrogant but we see it as bravery as a result of lucifers revolt he was cast out of heaven by god where he then fell to earth and bestowed the gift of knowledge to human kind specifically to eve in the garden of eden in genesis we see ourselves as aligning with a literary figure that is heavily misinterpreted and undertaking the same mission since we dont believe in the supernatural the concept of a nontheistic but satanic ritual seems like an oxymoron what is the destruction ritual ill preface by saying its not for invoking satan but rather combating harmful power over us just as lucifer the angel did in the bible the destruction ritual was born from a tradition i have done for many years with friends and loved ones on new years eve we would gather around a fire with some scraps of paper pens and a few bottles of liquor we would take turns writing things down on the pieces of paper reading them aloud throwing them into the fire and then taking a shot it would start out with us drawing dicks or writing silly stuff but as the night progressed and the bottles emptied we found ourselves sobbing hugging and getting some really sticky shit off our chests then one year we started bringing physical objects to destroy things that bore some kind of sentimental value we hung onto but in reality just sat in a box in a closet somewhere and caused us negative emotions when we remembered they were there we felt by hanging onto these objects we were holding onto the hope of a failed relationship or the improvement of someones character or a good memory we would cling to like this object was a life raft but all it did was hurt us my friend had a box of these creepy ceramic dogs her abusive grandfather gave her every year for her birthday another friend had an engagement ring from his ex fiance that cheated in him i had an antique childrens tambourine my ex gave me that i couldnt let go of for some reason as well as a bunch of photos and letters we took turns smashing our objects with hammers knives and throwing the pieces into the fire afterwards i felt a sense of empowerment i had never felt before and an epiphany the relationship was done but i had let it still continue to hurt me by giving power to this stupid little plastic tambourine and a box of paper by hanging onto them i allowed the toxicity to seep into my everyday and gave something inanimate delusional purpose we all cried hugged and stood around the fire silently watching the shards of our bad memories burn in the fire the destruction ritual serves this very purpose destroying objects that we have given the power to hurt us its a form of self love as you are trusting that by destroying these stupid things you will be stronger and lighter so to speak after doing it so much of our culture revolves around material possessions our social status is assigned by what we have our self worth is measured by what we have we go into debt to buy cars and clothes and technology that pollutes the environment and will probably break and need to be replaced within two years anyway in a way you could stretch it and say the destruction ritual is your own petty way of combating the detrimental effects of capitalism whatever floats your boat destruction ritual performed by the satanic temple in los angeles during the satanic mass of 2017 we performed this ritual which also involves an incantation at our satanic mass in january of 2017 wedding rings old medication bottles gifts from exes and a diary were among the things destroyed as i was reciting it i looked at the audience and saw a lot of crying faces our arizona chapter also performed it over the summer and it yielded a similar effect this thing sounds goofy but trust me it feels really really good so gather some loved ones or just grab a hammer and ride solo here is the how to for the destruction ritual how to perform the destruction ritual step one gather your objects preference is given to something youre holding onto that has a negative association to a person or memory or action maybe its something you hide so its not in sight everyday to cause you grief but its there and you cant let go of it it could be a possession or gift from someone abusive or cruel a piece of clothing from the old you bank statements or receipts from a time you made a poor financial decision a token of some kind of failure relationship friendship or a personal failure if something doesnt immediately come to mind you can improvise write angry things you want to get off your chest onto a piece of paper and put it in a glass bottle step two find a good place to do it ideally somewhere outdoors where its safe to get dirty and have sharp pieces of your freshly destroyed bad memories around its best to place plastic or something underneath so cleanup is easy and damage to surrounding area is minimized objects can also be placed on a platter of some kind fireplace bonfire or fire pit is a bonus step three choose your weapon depending on the objects you are destroying choose your weapon of destruction hammers daggers baseball bats crowbars mallets and knives work well its really up to you and the space available to you dont forget safety if you are destroying something shatterable like glass or ceramics wear safety glasses and gloves step four set the mood light some candles pick some music we recommend author punisher as an official tst destruction ritual selection and lay your objects and weapons of choice out step five recite the incantation the ave satanas are totally optional and up to you the reciter but theyre fun to yell these were things that i held in my hands these were things that belonged to me these were things that i held in my heart these were things that have meaning to me these things are not dead because they never carried life but i gave these things life because they have carried me i gave these things my memories my fear my secrets my tears my blood my devotion my hate my forgiveness my pain my pleasure my love my disdain i am the creator of life in these things for without me they would not be and people would seek to profit off what i give with no mutual heart given back to me we emancipate ourselves from this material slavery for without my heart these things would not be ave satanas we liberate ourselves from this endless cycle of voids filled with unnecessary greed i fill my voids with love and compassion i fill my voids with clarity i fill my void with the beauty that surrounds me i fill my voids with only that which propels me ave satanas together we raise our arms and unshackle ourselves from the control these things have over us together we raise our hammers and daggers and with them pierce the heart of that control a power driven by addiction attachment consumption and by a relentless hunger for excess ave satanas i do not belong to these things these things belong to me i do not belong to these things these things belong to me i do not belong to these things these things belong to me i do not belong to these things these things belong to me i do not belong to these things these things belong to me i do not belong to these things these things belong to me i do not belong to these things these things belong to me i do not belong to these things these things belong to me step six destroy your objects selfexplanatory discard the pieces afterwards theres no point in holding on have at it and be well ave satanas hail satan

politifact6146,1,david plouffe sen joe lieberman and gen michael hayden talk national security leaks so this is very very important that this is a twoyear period so that people can apply and it allows our law enforcement officials to focus on criminals who really posed a threat and ought to be the focus here but the only permanent way to fix our immigration system certainly to provide a permanently relief for dream act eligible populations is for congress to act wallace you mentioned governor romney i dont to get into the whole thing about the differences will get to the economy in a minute but specifically for hispanic voters do you think theres a clear choice between obama and romney plouffe i think theres a clear choice for everybody wallace well im asking about hispanics plouffe well first of all wallace on this issue of immigration plouffe well first of all hispanic voters highly support the health care bill what were trying to do in education on immigration yes this is a president whos tried to get immigration done in a comprehensive way were getting close to getting the dream act done so this is someone who believed that we are a nation of laws but also a nation of immigrants and that people who want to staff our labs and start businesses and serve their country ought to be able to do that governor romney has said he would veto the dream act governor romney essentially said the 11 million here ought to just go home they ought to self deport so this is someone youre not going to be able to trust and this one of the important choices that the president talked about earlier this week in ohio president romney if hes elected is not going to fix our immigration system hes been very clear about that you watch republican debate after republican debate many of them on your network where governor romney was very clear he would veto the dream act he thinks these 11 million people ought to just be sent home so i think thats a clear choice just not for the latino community but for the american electorate at large wallace all right lets turn to the economy the president gave a major economic speech this week in ohio in which he called for targeted investments for things like energy and education and state workers first responders and teachers and tax hikes for the wealthy but there was forgive me nothing new is that the presidents agenda for the next four years pass the jobs plan that i have been pushing for over the last 12 months and that will fix the economy plouffe what the president laid out is a clear choice facing the american people and the contrast could not be clear this is a president who believes we need to grow the economy by putting the middle class first creating middle class jobs by reducing the deficit in a fair or balanced way and making sure we can invest in things like innovation and infrastructure and science and research the congressional republican approach governor romneys approach by the way its fitting hes with john boehner today because governor romney is going to rubber stamp the republican agenda which basically gives huge tax cuts for the wealthy they believe the economy works best from the top down thats failed by the way governor romney wouldnt reduce the deficit every independent economists whos looked at this plan says he would add to the deficit he would starve investment in education he would allow infrastructure to deteriorate even more this is not a recipe for growing the economy reducing the deficit or helping the middle class so thats the stark choice wallace does the presidents agenda because i did not hear anything new in ohio is the presidents agenda for the next four years more of the same plouffe well what it is is what this country needs to do which is reduce the deficit in a right way fair and balanced way wallace i like the fact that you keep saying fair and balanced plouffe well its the right way which is we need to cut more spending this president has already signed into law by the way over almost 2 trillion on spending cuts we have to focus on what is going to grow this economy for the middle class and thats going to be continuing to focus on our manufacturing wallace but you would agree there is no new agenda beyond what he is pushing for the last year plouffe this is the direction he thinks that the country needs to go now lets look at the other direction it failed miserably when governor romney led massachusetts number one debt in the country think about that added debt for all of this talk about government for every private sector job created in massachusetts by governor romney six public sector jobs this is someone who his state was 47 in job creation and he wants to return to the same policies that led to the great recession that you know caused a huge harm to our businesses our economy and people in this country so the choice is clear here wallace ok plouffe the choice is clear wallace i have a couple of minutes left and i want to get to these campaign questions you were the obama campaign manager in 2008 i ask about whether theres anything new because you are taking hits right now you the campaign from some notable democrats like james carville and bill clinton who are saying that you need to stop talking about the progress weve made and start talking about a new agenda how things in the next four years are going to be different than they were in the last one are they wrong plouffe first of all president clinton hes appeared with president obama he said very clearly that we are beginning to grow again were beginning to make progress we cant return to the same policy president clinton is someone knows something about reducing the deficit about creating jobs and hes been very clear he thinks mitt romney would be a disaster for this country so listen those other democrats arent paying attention to what the president said which is everyday not just on what he said but what he does he understands our economy is not strong as it needs to be that this didnt happen overnight its going to take us a long time to recover theres a lot of people out there hurting so we are making progress we need to make a lot of more thats very clear wallace but you said just a few months ago that trajectory in the economy is going well we had fewer and fewer jobs each of the last four months gdp growth is 19 percent 69000 jobs the lowest in the year created the trajectory is not going like this anymore sir its going like this plouffe well compared to where we were in recession we had over 4 million jobs created over the last 26 months we had that private sector jobs wallace but youve got three and a half years to fix it plouffe well listen this is a deep hole caused by the same policies mitt romney wants to go back to this is what folks need to focus on we just went through recession remarkably what mitt romney and the congressional republicans want to do is hey i guess that worked out well lets go back to the same rules let wall street writes its own rules make it easier to polluters to foul our air more huge tax cuts to people like mitt romney and basically paid for by raising taxes on working americans and making it harder for people to get education not believing in the new energy future not rebuilding this country so listen this is a tough recession we are recovering from we are making slow and steady progress nobody is satisfied the president most of all knows we have to recover more quickly create jobs more quickly but the choice is are we going to continue and move forward are we going to go back to the same policies that caused the recession wallace i got it one last question plouffe its important nothing is more important than this chris wallace one more question real quickly any chance youll leave the white house go back to chicago and run this campaign

gossipcop-868919,1,naked wardrobe is the affordable basics brand the kardashians and j lo cant stop wearing shida kaviani shirin kaviani shideh kaviani those names probably dont immediately ring any bells but a mention of the sisters popular and super affordable clothing brand naked wardrobe should do the trick the label whose instagram page boasts over 11 million followers was founded in 2012 on the desire to create basic wardrobe essentialsbodysuits biker shorts and figurehugging dresses all of which fall under the 100 price pointthat not only look good but feel good and makes customers happy all at an affordable price in six years naked wardrobes initial collection has expanded to include luxe faux fur coats sexy thong bathing suits and other latenightready pieces with fastfashion brands and influencers dominating our social feeds loyalty is the hardest thing for a brand to obtain and the easiest thing for them to lose but naked wardrobe doesnt seem to have that problem especially when the kardashianjenner sisters jennifer lopez lady gaga and beyonce are pretty much the brands unofficial brand ambassadors we caught up with the founders of naked wardrobe to get the scoop on how they got their start the secret to running their cultfavorite brand and how theyve built their celebrity clientele naked wardrobe is six this year howd it all start shideh we started out of our parents house six years ago it all started because we all have a shopping addiction we have a passion for fashion and for ordering stuff online and having them be delivered to our door back then when we first started doing ecomm people were really hesitant to shop online it just wasnt the norm back then and social media was different but social media allowed us to have this platform to really grow our business did you all study any fashion in school shideh yeah i studied fashion design at fidm and i got a bachelors in business management so i definitely had some direction and insight when it came to fashion and the business side of things shida i studied communications and pr and i worked in pr i got my feet wet at capitol records and warner brothers pr and learned the ropes in that aspect shirin i studied graphic design and i have a little bit of a computer science background i work well with a computerim a little bit of a geekso an online shop was kind of the way to go for that and is what pushed us to launch one what was the initial reason you all launched naked wardrobe shideh high quality fashion at an affordable price either it was high quality and you had to pay like 100 for a tshirt or get something that was not as high quality and more on the disposable end for 1525 there werent many affordable options then and at that time the recession was still impacting the economy i felt like it was important to introduce a line that was really high in quality but still affordable for the masses shirin were aware that the majority of the world cant afford 100 pieces and we wanted to make sure that if we bring out a line that you can wash x amount of times its still not going to get damaged that when you wear it you feel great and comfortable the fabric feels amazing and thats why a lot of celebrities gravitate towards it whether they wear it or someone whos interning wears it were all the same in the end and its nice that everyone from different spectrums can wear the brand how long after you launched did business really start to pick up shideh when we first started we really didnt know where it would go we thought we would be able to wear a bunch of free clothes that we were selling ourselves but from the first day we launched we started to bring in the revenue and its just been growing ever since walk me through the creative process shideh when it comes to designing i want it to be something thats comfortable sexy that people feel good in my sister shirin is really adamant about us creating trends and starting things and revolutionizing different fashions so she helps me to put out pieces that are innovative but still basic at the same time when you think basics you think god it must be so easy to find because its something simple but its truly harder to find something so simple so we really strive to do that when it comes to our color palette we like to test the waters but were true neutral lovers were very black white brown and grey but people like color so we like to incorporate some pieces with color throughout the years were in the age of fastfashion so when it comes to manufacturing and production on our end we try to do 90 of it here locally so that we can have more control our typical turnaround is anywhere from two to four weeks and if something sells out were able to replenish in a timely manner we dont have many production issues and i think thats our strong suit customers are a lot more conscious when it comes to brands who push for inclusivity how do you make sure every woman is represented shideh i think something thats really important to us and has been from the start is the fabric choices the last thing we want is for them to order the garments get it and then it doesnt fit in specific places we wanted the main selling point to be when they receive the product it looks good but feels good and makes customers happy all at an affordable price we really think about those things in the initial design state and when were selecting the design fabric if something doesnt have enough stretch its not gonna fit everybody type we owe it all to our fabric shirin the three of us have different body types as well so we think about that when we design with 12 million followers and a booming clothing label what are some of the challenges you all face shideh social media really shideh we owe all our success to social media because it provided us a platform to reach everyone in the world but instagram has definitely changed over the years all these brands came onto the platform and saw the power instagram had and wanted to get a piece of the pie a lot of brands came and changed things around so its been quite challenging learning how to maneuver and what its going to take for people to engage more or bring our following up something we dont do with our brand in particular is paid advertisements were all about having organic traffic so we dont do any paid posts at allon social media or any avenue so where most brands are paying influencers to market their products our challenge is targeting more people and growing the brand organically why take that approach instead of just going the easy route and paying these influencers shideh influencers are running instagram and we know a lot of people look at brands that pay influencers to promote like can we trust this brand its really hard for us to stay away from that type of marketing especially when we can see our competitors doing that but for us its so important for people to truly like the brand and for them to buy the products themselves how else would you say naked wardrobe has set themselves apart from its competitors shideh i think we just really created this cult following because people truly love the product and it really speaks for itself even though the economy has changed and everything is a lot more expensive we never bring our prices up while continuing to maintain the same quality shirin its really the product we do have customers that write we see your clothes on j lo thank you for not raising your prices even though all these celebrities are wearing your brand we make it a point to stay true to the brand no matter whos wearing it and people appreciate that why is it important for you all to keep naked wardrobe at an affordable price point even with all the recognition the brand has received shideh the majority of our followers dont have millions of dollars to spend on clothing its really important to us to cater to that group instead of the celebrities shida from day one we wanted to create an affordable highquality line its always been our vision and we never had any intention of changing that really is our mission and its something we have to stay true to do we take a lot of losses on our end because of it sure absolutely but we do whatever we can to please our customers shirene if we could give away clothes for free we would we actually donate a ton of clothing at the end of each year when people hear naked wardrobe what type of woman do you want them to envision shideh every woman its the woman going to the club going on a date going to the store or even the one at the gym shida well thats your interpretation when i think about the girl who wears naked wardrobe i think about a fabulous sexy woman who also loves to be comfortable shes your everyday girl who loves to look amazing while doing her daytoday tasks shirin shes just a bad bitch simple how did naked wardrobe first land on the karjenner sisters radar shideh one of our models who was a part of our team was affiliated with the sisters because she used to work for fashion police on e one day we decided that we were going to send a package out to khloe not knowing whether or not she was going to wear it or whether she was going to like it but we sent it anyways its been love ever since then really the product speaks for itself so when we send out these packages to the celebs we just bite the bullet and hope theyll wear at least one thing every time we introduce naked wardrobe to a new celebrity client they keep wearing the pieces for like the next few weeks were been fortunate to connect with so many celebrity stylists and theyve been so gracious enough to respond to us and they have become fans of the brand very organically jennifer lopez and lady gaga are also fans of the brand shideh its surreal beyonce has naked wardrobe as well her stylist hit us up and told us she loves the brand so its just a matter of time before she wears us out in public our line is affordable and you wouldnt think that these celebs who have access to all the brands in the book would choose to wear our this budget friendly brand why would they wear a 30 dress when they can wear a saint laurent gown for thousands of dollars we say this a lot but i think thats the most rewarding part about this
gossipcop-8581615474,0,katie holmes trials fighting reports about a jamie foxx breakup and a tom cruise suri reunion poor katie holmes that is if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former dawsons creek actress and her relationships with boyfriend jamie foxx exhusband tom cruise and daughter suri according to a report in radaronline holmes and foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish 300000 ceremony with 12yearold suri as her bridesmaid this supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating but then the 39yearold actress and single mom realized her 50yearold oscarwinning boyfriend wasnt ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways including his friendly relationship with kristin grannis his exgirlfriend and mother to his 8yearold daughter radaronline reported indeed foxx took grannis not holmes with him to leonardo dicaprios birthday party in november the site alleges so holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her django unchained boyfriend they needed to break up jamie balked at the idea of signing a prenup with a nocheating clause because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly a source told radaronline katie noticed a total lack of respect in jamies behavior she knew it wasnt healthy for her or suri and she has to protect them both at the same time holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her megastar exhusband cruise to push his way back into their daughter suris life according to hollywood life citing a report by star magazine cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years because his church of scientology bosses told him he couldnt see her tom is a loyal scientologist so when church leaders told him he couldnt see suri he didnt question it an insider told the star but toms tired of being bossed around by them hes had to watch from afar as suri grew into a lovely young lady and he regrets that hes missed out on so much hes dying to be a part of her life holmes isnt a fan of a reunion given that she agreed to stay quiet about cruise and scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to brainwash her into becoming a part of the controversial selfstyled religious organization the star reported but holmes also was torn because she wants to do whats best for suri shes slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion an insider told the star suri must desperately be missing her dad and in the end katie only wants whats best for her tom has assured her he wont bring his religion into it and katie is starting to believe him representatives for holmes have denied both the report about her and foxx breaking up and the report about a cruise and suri reunion but notably the denial about the foxx breakup report comes from holmes publicist who was willing to attach her name to her statement the radar story is 100 percent untrue leslie sloane the representative for holmes told people people and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that holmes publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official ontherecord acknowledgement from either holmes or foxx that a relationship has even existed after the two reportedly began dating in 2013 they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret with holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant the secrecy was necessary because holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup according to reports in september 2017 those reports came after holmes and foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking handinhand on a malibu beach there was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that fiveyear public dating ban had expired they were finally ready to announce to the world that they were a couple since then holmes and foxx have been spotted together more openly at various events including sitting next to each other at clive daviss pregrammy awards gala in january people reported holmes also turned up at foxxs 50th birthday party in los angeles in middecember holmes romantic history has long been marked by intense highprofile highs and devastating lows especially surrounding her highoctane courtship and marriage to cruise holmes and cruise got engaged in 2005 after just seven weeks of dating cruise famously gushed about his love for holmes by jumping on oprah winfreys tv show couch they became parents to daughter suri in 2006 and married in a lavish church of scientology wedding in an italian castle holmes initiated the divorce from cruise because she reportedly became concerned about raising suri as a scientologist numerous investigative reports over the years have shown that the church exercises an enormous amount of control over the lives of members including over how parents raise their children critics regard scientology as a mindcontrolling cult what appears certain about holmes life is that shes been a devoted protective mother to suri doing the best she can to raise her on her own numerous reports describe suri as an intelligent kindhearted girl with holmes herself opening up about her daughters philanthropic heart in a 2015 interview with today my little one is very very generous and very sensitive holmes said according to people over the years their motherdaughter bond has been documented in photos at events as in when suri and holmes appeared on the madison square garden stage together in december to introduce taylor swift at the jingle ball concert holmes also has shared images of their sometimes playful friendly bond in a series of photos she has posted to instagram

gossipcop-869467,1,how did maddox become angelina jolies aide during the making of the movie lara croft tomb raider angelina visited cambodia for the first time the second time she went there was on a unhcr field trip soon after that in 2001 angelina went back to cambodia this time with billy bob thornton who was her husband at the time and that is when they saw maddox joliepitt in an orphanage in battambang soon afterward they started the adoption process in the spring of 2002 the actress took maddox who was only 7 months old from the orphanage angelina was thinking of adopting a child for a while but didnt want to take any action before she made sure what did loung ung think about the whole situation she and loung ung became friends shortly after the actress came across her memoir first they killed my father and she wanted to know what is loungs opinion of her adopting a cambodian baby i asked her as a cambodian orphan if she would be offended for somebody like me an outsider to do that or if that would be a nice thing the actress shared with vanity fairs september issue loung of course was thrilled by the proposal angie was maternal to everybody around her not just children but adults included i wanted her to adopt me i was orphaned when i was 8 years old and so i think when youve gone through experiences like that theres always a part of you that craves to have full parent figures in your life the author said if loung had said otherwise angelina says it might have changed her mind as she was looking around the orphanage she recalled i didnt feel a connection with any of them they said theres one more baby as soon as she locked eyes with maddox she remembers i cried and cried during that time the actress was a resident in her house in cambodia in 2003 angelina started a project that is now known as the maddox joliepitt foundation which is concentrating primarily on the asian countrys environmental conservation education health and infrastructure in the following years angelina found brad pitt and together they have had five more children besides her acting career angelina finds happiness in working as a filmmaker and being a un ambassador maddox who is now a teenager is going after his mother he wanted with angelinas help to let the whole world know loungs story he was the one who said its time to do it she shared with the magazine maddox put faith in his mother to proceed with historical horror justice and now its time for angelina to put the faith in her son to help her during the filming as soon as maddox said he will take part in this it came to her mind that he will be watching horrors that his countrymen did to each other so he had to be ready pax joliepitt took part as a still photographer during which time the rest of the joliepitt kids were on set every day it was time for angelina and loung to start planning the scenario and maddox helped them by looking into some of the drafts they made analyzing them and then giving them his thoughts on how certain aspect of the scenario should develop the actress gave it to netflix and ted sarandos the chief creative officer fell in love with it immediately in the room she created a visual experience of what this film could be the film is in many ways about the death of beauty about the way the khmer rouge had killed all things beautiful the color itself which becomes part of the joy of life ted said thats what hooked me more than anything alongside with the cambodian moviemaker said that the only way she will proceed with the making of this movie is if the cambodian residents dont have a problem with them doing it in a country like cambodia respect is very much elevatedrespect for each other respect for the culture respect for the history respect for the elders loung shared with vanity fair angie walks in cambodia with this respect cambodians gave their support and the country administered the usage of certain locations and allowed them to use 500 soldiers from its corps its not a poetic thing to saythis film was made by the country told the actress around 3500 citizens participated in the movie there wasnt a person who was working on the movie who didnt have a personal connection they werent coming to do a job they were walking in the exodus for the people whom they had lost in their family and it was out of respect for them that they were going to recreate itit completed something for them while in the making of the movie everybody was looking at maddox they all knew who he and his mom were it was a way for him to walk in the steps that most likely his birth parents walked said angelina who didnt know how maddox was going to take everything that was happening to him and around him she was exceptionally happy when one day maddox asked for her permission to stay the night in his house with his friends by his house he meant the house angelina bought back in 2002 i hadnt heard him refer to it that way you cant push it you cant say isnt this great you just have to kind of keep bringing them there putting it in front of them and hope that they find the pride and find the comfort while maddox was angelinas fidus achates on set that is not what is happening back home not since angelina is going through a custody battle with brad pitt i do not want my children to be worried about me i think its very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them she reveals to vanity fair they need to know that everythings going to be all right even when youre not sure it is even though her first boy has burdened himself with a lot more things than an average teenage boy has with taking care of his younger siblings he doesnt have that big of a desire to became an adult yet im conscious that the boys are teenage boys and maybe theyd rather be watching tv with their friends and theyve been to africa and they may not be as excited as the little ones she commented regarding their travels but they dont really challenge me they just kind of sit on the edge of my bed and say what are we going to do there and she takes them on all these amusing things they could do for example sandboarding either way they know that its important and they know that mom thinks that its going to be important when theyre older via eonline

responses to that initial question limited to two minutes with a oneminute rebuttal from the other candidate and then there will be an opportunity for all of us to mix it up a little bit to get into a

order for this evening we begin with twominute opening statements from each of the candidates and we begin with chris coons chris coons dde senatorial candidate thank you thank you president harker to our moderators wolf blitzer nancy karibjanian and to our hosts ud center for political communications and delaware first media theres a great deal at stake in this election for our state for our families and for our country all of us regardless of our political leanings recognize that washington is broken as ive traveled up and down the state the last nine months as a candidate listening to voters talk about the issues facing them in their daily lives ive heard again and again their frustration with washington and with elected officials who are putting narrow partisan agendas ahead of the good of our country and doing little to help millions of americans out of work or on the verge of losing their homes or who are anxious about their futures the partisan gridlock in washington has real implications for us in delaware theres more than 35000 delawareans still out of work and nearly 3000 families that have faced foreclosure this year these arent just numbers in delaware these are our neighbors and we cant simply stand by and watch washington ignore us or them any longer in this election delawares voters face a clear and important choice between on the one hand my opponent a candidate who wants to take our state and candidate back to the failed economic policies of the past who values partisan bickering over compromise and solutions and who i believe has extreme positions that threaten vital education programs and would abandon our commitment to our veterans and on the other hand in my case a candidate with a proven track record of balancing budgets finding bipartisan solutions working with delawares businesses large and small helping to create jobs and spur growth advertisement over the next 90 minutes i look forward to the chance to share with you my ideas and values delaware values that i learned growing up in hokesen working here in newark with one of delawares most innovative manufacturing companies and leading delawares second largest government i take seriously the idea this campaign is a job interview and tonights debate is about giving delawares voters an insight into which candidate has the experience the values and the ideas to best represent them and do the hard work of fixing whats broken in washington thank you karibjanian your opening statement odonnell thank you thank you to our hosts and for everyone being here tonight im running because im concerned about the direction of our country the america we knew and grew up with is being threatened in the most serious way in just three years we will be paying 1 billion a day on the interest alone on our national debt the common sense men and women in this room and all across delaware know this is not sustainable yet my opponent wants to go to washington and rubberstamp the failed spending bills that are coming from that have cost us 25 million jobs this is wrong uncle sam needs to be cut off with your vote and your support i want to go to washington to create jobs based on private business not your tax dollars i want to fight to have our nation become debt free i want to stop the tax hikes that are coming in january i want to reach sustainable energy independence support the military and strengthen the security of our homeland i want to fight to safeguard social security improve education and protect our constitutional liberties and in an election year when so much is at stake just about every candidate says this yet what distinguishes one candidate from another are the proposed solutions to reach these goals i very much look forward to getting down to brass tacks with all of you over the next 90 minutes because i believe there is a clear choice in this election a vote for my opponent will cost the average delaware family 10000 instantly between the january tax hikes and his vote for cap and trade advertisement most of us cant afford that if you think that government is too small and that your taxed too little if youre ever questioned whether america is a beacon of freedom and justice then hes your guy but if you want a us senator who will stand up to the washington elite who will put your interests ahead of the special interests and make the tough decisions needed to rein in an out of control washington then i humbly ask you to vote odonnell for us senate thank you karibjanian all right were now getting into our question portion of the evening and ill begin with you mr coons creating jobs to get america back to work clearly has to be a priority to do americans voted overwhelmingly for democrats during the last election because most felt that the democrats would be able to fix the failing economy unemployment is at 96 almost three quarters of americans in the most recent cnnopinion research corporation poll said that the economy is still in a recession so why should the voters of delaware trust a democrat this time around coons well nancy thanks for your question i think the voters of delaware should trust this democrat because of my combination of experience working in the private sector and working with the private sector handson work helping one of delawares most innovative companies expand and grow jobs and concrete and engaged work working with our chamber of commerce our business roundtable the committee of 100 lots of groups who represent businesses large and small to effectively grow the economy ive also presented as a candidate for the senate concrete and real ideas theyre on my web site but i look forward to the chance to go over them in some detail tonight i would advocate for a research and development tax credit and expand our tax credit thats combined with a new manufacturing tax credit that advocates for companies that invent things here and make them here getting an extra inventive i also think we need to change the crazy tax policy in washington that gives an incentive to american companies to shut down operations here and ship jobs overseas advertisement theres other things ive proposed expanding the home office tax credit expanding a tax credit for starting a new business that employs folks within the first couple of years fighting harder in trade policy to make sure were not letting our trading partners take advantage of us in trade deals that were signed over previous years doing more in investment and innovation at the end of the day i think delaware has a long tradition of inventing and manufacturing world class products the best way for us to get out of this recession is through growth the best way to growth is by taking advantage of the skills and resources of a world class university like this one where were having this debate this evening and tying that to a stronger more qualified more capable workforce giving it the resources and the energy it needs to be once again the leader in the world in creating high quality high value manufacturing jobs those are some of the ideas i look forward to discussing more this evening thank you karibjanian ms odonnell you have one minute for a rebuttal odonnell well first we have to keep in mind my opponent has a history of promising not to raise taxes on the campaign trail and then break those promises as soon as he takes office unemployment here in new castle county rose almost doubled in the last two years under his watch as new castle county executive now when it comes to the policies that he has said on the campaign trail he will continue to rubberstamp the spending policies coming from washington we were promised that the stimulus bill would create jobs but instead it cost us 26 million jobs we were promised that it would keep unemployment at 8 but instead we see unemployment at 97 the democrats are bragging that unemployment has leveled out but while unemployment has leveled out more people than ever are on food stamps and our welfare spending is higher than ever this is not the right move this is not a move towards real economic recovery this is a move towards creating a culture of dependency i believe the best thing the government karibjanian thats the time sorry but now we get to open it to discussion odonnell great blitzer well what specifically ms odonnell would you do specifically to create jobs odonnell what i think the best thing the government can do to get our economy back on real economic recovery is for to get out of the way of the small business owner and get out of the way of the entrepreneur and the way you do that is to make sure these tax hikes dont come in january you begin to roll back some of the regulation thats forced them to close their doors advertisement a couple of that things im proposing and number one a temporary twoyear tax holiday on the capital gains tax to give investors the money they need to reinvest in business to permanently eliminate the death tax thats not only an unjust bill because weve paid taxes while we saved it but it will also create 15 million new jobs karibjanian let me just remind that we are in the discussion portion so you can interject here as well as we continue to discussion that point coons im not sure i understand what ms odonnell means when she says this is simply create ago culture of dependency and that her primary objective would be to end the endless regulation and red tape she denounces the obama administration says its done nothing to promote job growth when frankly just a few weeks ago a new bill that would provide expanded sba loan capacity 30 billion worth of new lending capability tarp funds that have been repaid and are being repurchased towards small and midsized banks all over the united states real and concrete steps are being taken i also frankly cant imagine where she found the numbers that unemployment doubled in just the past year under my watch i ssuspect were going to need to keep a close eye this evening on the numbers that go flying back and forth blitzer lets ask her where did you get those numbers odonnell the department of labor statistics and well have them on our web site by tomorrow but i want to point out that he said that were not creating a culture of dependency how would you explain what is happening when unemployment is leveled out but more and more people are on food stamps weve got to ask ourselves what do we want delawareans to be receiving food stamps or paychecks i say paychecks advertisement coons obviously paychecks wed like to have americans able to receive the benefits they need to get through incredibly difficult times but to simply denounce people as being dependent because theyre applying for and receiving food stamps odonnell oh chris thats not fair coons in the worst recession in modern times odonnell thats not fair of you to say coons is frankly slandering people who are in incredibly difficult times odonnell that fair of you to say that because thats not at all what im doing im not the person who would cut the tax benefits for disabled and lowincome senior citizens as you did as county executive but what im proposing is to give these tax to make sure that the tax cults for our delawareans do not expire this january you have said that you will stop the tax cuts for the socalled rich what you fail to realize is the socalled rich are the small business owner the drycleaner down the street the pizza shop owner who makes 300000 before they pay their four employees before they feed their own family blitzer ill have you respond coons ms odonnell were going to try to have a conversation here this evening rather than just a diatribe if we possibly could i think it would be helpful to have an exchange of ideas and let each of us take turns so thank you for moderating wolf i think its important to look closely at some of the things ms odonnells thrown out on her new web site most of them are untrue some of them are flatout lies some of them are mischaracterizations some are just factually untrue so im not going to stop every single time theres something she throws out that i disagree with or i think is factually untrue but let me just say at the outset that much of what youve put out much of how youve characterized my record is incorrect and if we simply sit here and say thats not true were not going to make much progress blitzer do you support keeping the bush tax cuts for all americans or only those make under 200000 a year advertisement coons i suppose extending the bush tax cuts for the overwhelming majority of americans i dont think we should draw an arbitrary line at 250000 but the value that i will apply as deciding how much to extend whether it goes up to 1 million or 2 million or 5 millions that weve got a tough choice to make every increased tax cut every extension thats given is going to cost its going to increase the deficit it adds to the debt and heres the primary value i would apply in deciding whether to extend all the bush tax cuts and for how long i think we should do those tax cuts that have the best chance of getting our economy going again blitzer all right karibjanian were out of time though for this discussion blitzer but youre going to have an opportunity to get back into this discussion because this is issue number one jobs jobs jobs also the deficit i want to get into the deficit right now youve made the point that the national debt is exploding the budget deficit is exploding right now i want some specific meaningful cuts if youre elected a senator from delaware what would you cut in the federal budget and dont just say waste fraud and abuse because everybody says that what would you cut specifically odonnell thats a great question because first of all we have got to tackle the deficit and the debt because our deficit is almost becoming equal to our national gdp when your deficit a countrys deficit equals your gdp thats when your currency collapses your market collapses weve got to take drastic measures blitzer so what would you cut odonnell first of all cancel the unspent stimulus bill second of all put a freeze on nondiscretionary on discretionary spending put a hiring freeze on nonsecurity personnel and then of course when were talking about cutting government spending weve got to talk about waste fraud and abuse a recent report came out said we spend over 1 billion in medicaid waste fraud and abuse were talking about pharmacies billing for prescriptions given to dead people were talking about home health care companies billing for patients who were in the hospital advertisement senator coburn recently put out a report called schoolhouse pork that disclosed millions of dollars that were supposed to go to education funding that instead went to special favors now special favors are something that my opponent knows very much about because he created 12 contingency funds so that he could pay out favors to special interest groups the courts forced him to close 11 of them but of the one that remained open he paid 53000 in a mens fashion show he paid another more than 50000 to appease liberal special interest groups at a time when he brags about balancing the budget by raising our taxes cutting policemen pay this is how he chooses to spend our tax dollars weve got to ask do we want to send this gentleman to washington dc i would say no hes a career politician who has proven he knows how to play the ill scratch your back you scratch mine game blitzer you have a minute to respond coons theres so much to respond to wolf a minute may not be enough let me get back to the focus of the question is what would you do to tackle the deficit and the debt i think we have some very large challenges in front of us the overwhelming majority of federal spending is made up by defense spending medicare medicaid social security and interest on the debt while the president has proposed and i would seriously consider supporting a freeze on non defense discretionary spending for three years which would achieve significant reductions ive also identified on my web site a series of reductions that i would support some of them are in agricultural price supports some are in federal office space for example or hiring and several are in defense programs defense acquisition that the pentagon itself has already said they no longer need the c17 program for example or the second engine for the f35 theres a variety of platforms and programs that i think we can simply do away with as we invest in making our defense and our military more modern more flexible more responsive to the real threats we face in the modern world and as we continue to achieve some savings through the brac program and other things that have shown a real capacity to save advertisement karibjanian lets open the discussion on correcting some of the financial issues here by talk about some of your own personal financial problems and most people know about it by now including an irs lien that was for about 12000 in taxes and penalties from 05 there was the 08 mortgage default judgment on your home you just received your bachelors degree as you said because it took a decade to pay of the tuition the question then is how can voters rely upon your thoughts on how to manage the deficit if youre having such personal financial issues of your own odonnell well first of all that irs tax lien the irs already admitted that it was a computer error and my opponent should not be bringing that up because as ive gone up and down the campaign trail ive discovered there are thousands of delawareans who have faced the same thing an irs mistake has caused them greatly which is all the more reason why we need to reform the irs not put them in control of our health care second of all you mentioned education i dont have a trust fund i didnt come from a privileged sheltered background as my opponent says he did karibjanian lets stay to the issue of paying bills odonnell i am i paid for my own college education i also have a graduate fellowship in constitutional government from the claremont institute i know how hard it is to earn and keep a dollar and one of the reasons why the delawareans should be able to trust me is because when i did in this economy i worked for nonprofit groups nonprofit groups were the first to have been hurt when i fell upon difficult times i made the sacrifices needed to set things right i sold my house and i sold a lot of my possessions in order to pay of my personal debt and to become in a stronger position i have worked hard in order to get to the position that i am so i can relate to the thousands of delaware families that are suffering right now and im stronger for it i made it through to the other side and thats where leadership doesnt count in whether or not you fall it counts in whether or not youve gotten up and thats what ive done advertisement karibjanian lets just remember were in the discussion portion so if you have anything you want to address on things that have been said on this topic thus far go for it coons well nancy i frankly think that we need to focus in this debate this evening and in the campaign not on personal financial difficulties or background earns but on the issues in front of us the things that delawareans are concerned about how do we tackle the deficit and debt how do we get delaware back to work theres been lots of discussion in the national media about things my opponent has said or done that i frankly think are a distraction from the core issues that delawareans ask about ask both of us about odonnell youre just jealous that you werent coons what would you do in washington odonnell on saturday night live coons im im dying to see whos going to play me christine blitzer well lets on a serious note lets get through some of the accusations that shed made and and well give you a chance to respond coons please blitzer that coons on the idea that somehow i was the one responsible for being sued for creating 11 12 shes confusing me with my predecessor tom gordon blitzer what were talking about is county executive coons yes blitzer new castle county executive you raised property taxes according to reports three times 25 percent hike in the last fiscal year you proposed new taxes on hotels paramedic services even 911 calls from cell phones is that true advertisement coons no its not true that we proposed a tax on the calls to the 911 center in any case odonnel its not true coons research into that would reveal that its difficult its complicated but ill take ill take a blitzer well explain your record on on taxes did you increase taxes as the county executive coons wolf let me walk you through for a moment whats happened because one of the attacks my opponents made repeatedly is that ive driven the county to the edge of bankruptcy thats on her newest attack nothing could be the further from the truth today new castle county has a surplus when i became executive in 05 it had a deficit i have worked hard over six years to defend a very significant reserve which has made it possible for us to continue to have a triplea bond rating out of 3000 roughly 3000 counties in america roughly 30 have a triplea bond rating and i reached a bipartisan solution odonnel it says stop coons that cut more in spending than was raised in taxes blitzer all right a quick response and then well move to the next odonnell youve been criticized for saying that you brought the county to triple a bond rating you inherited that good rating and how would you justify cutting the tax exception for low income seniors and disabled seniors cutting our policeman pay when you wastefully spent so much money on appeasing the special interest groups advertisement you simply cant justify that that is a career politician that is cronyism we dont need any more of that in washington blitzer very quickly because we got to move to the next series of questions do you want to respond to that coons theres a lot to respond to in that blitzer do it in 30 seconds coons thats going to be difficult wolf but ill tell you that im proud of my record as new castle county executive the very hard choices that had to be made to clean up the government every time you get a bond rating you earned a bond rating ms odonnells not familiar with how bond ratings work each time you go to the bond market you are rerated moodys in their letter of rating just two weeks ago said that it was because of the conservative fiscal policies of my administration that we have reearned a triple a bond rating from all three agencies blitzer all right lets move on to the next series of questions on national security foreign policy right now a hundred thousand american men and women are serving in the military in afghanistan right now the president of afghanistan hamid karzai has now acknowledged hes in direct talks with the taliban leadership wants to create what he calls a peace council heres the question and it goes to mr coons would you support a negotiated settlement in afghanistan that includes taliban representation would that be acceptable to you a deal between hamid karzai and the taliban advertisement coons wolf im concerned about the security of our troops in the field and about honoring the service and the sacrifice of our veterans the war in afghanistan is the war of the two that weve been engaged in iraq and afghanistan that i think was justified by a direct attack on the united states by the taliban who were offering harbor to al qaeda who were the authors of the 911 attack and i think in our 10th year now on the ground in afghanistan we have to look hard at whether were continuing to contribute to americas security by having 100000 troops on the ground i would support a negotiated resolution to the war that allowed us leave security and intelligence assets in place and that allowed us the opportunity to reengage should the taliban take control again or allow al qaeda to reemerge as a real threat to the region or to the united states weve spent 13 trillion in iraq and afghanistan it has significantly contributed to our debt we have lost more than 5000 american servicemen and women and ive got folks who i am personally close to who are deployed now for the third or fourth tour we have asked a lot of our men and women in the field they have delivered brilliantly but frankly the mission has exceeded the scope that i think we could initially reasonably expect of them i am far more concerned about the threats to our security posed by an unstable pakistan posed by iran and posed by an endless war in a country where were trying to build a nation where there really hasnt been one in modern times blitzer you have one minute to respond odonnell well i would ask him if hes serious about making sure that afghanistan doesnt become a safe haven for terrorists why on the campaign trail he has said that he supports this random time withdrawal advertisement we have to support our men and women who are risking their lives many of them have already given their lives over there a random withdrawal that he has said he support will simply embolden the terrorists to come out after us even more saying ive chased away the super power when we withdraw from iraq we need to make sure that there are benchmarks in place those benchmarks are making sure that theres a government that a representative government over there that serves the needs of the people and that can defend themselves when weve reached these benchmarks thats when we withdraw blitzer you want to respond to that coons she said withdraw from iraq i suspect you meant withdraw from afghanistan odonnell no from afghanistan did i say iraq im sorry thank you chris youre correct i meant afghanistan coons if were talking about afghanistan odonnell yes thank you coons and you know frankly i come from a family of veterans i come from a family that has dedicated a lot to the service of our nation and i wear a flag pin every day to remain me of the young man who grew up next door to me who was killed in iraq in december of 2005 i never take lightly the enormous sacrifices that our servicemen and women have made now and that we ask them to continue making i dont know how long is too long but 10 years strikes me as awfully long and i question whether your standard whether your principles give us any hope of winding up this war on any reasonable timeline because frankly the government of hamid karzai has proven itself to be largely corrupt and to be frankly ineffective at establishing control over the whole country we are doing our best we have dedicated trillions hundreds of billions of dollars to this conflict and im frankly deeply concerned that its a conflict without a reasonable end in sight there are times in history odonnell saying that youre coons the best way to honor the sacrifice of servicemen and women is to come up with a plan to responsibly wind down a conflict advertisement odonnell and that plan should be based on those benchmarks the benchmarks that means that we have had success again youre saying hallow rhetoric when you you say that your top priority is the concern for the safety of us on the homeland if you seriously support this random time withdrawal because again all were going to do is embolden the terrorists to think that they have more power than they do and i would ask you you know a couple of times whether its the tax cuts or even here in this kind of veiled youve gone back and forth on what you just said in afghanistan do you support the president or dont you support the president with the tax cuts youre saying that you dont support the president coons ms odonnell lets stay focused odonnell are you going to tell him that when he comes on friday coons lets stay focused on the issue in front of us which is afghanistan youve suggested gauzy benchmarks odonnell and its you youre jumping around coons no were staying focused on the issue of afghanistan rather than jumping to other issues odonnell and you jumped around you said that security coons ms odonnell karibjanian lets let lets let coons the core issue here karibjanian mr coons finish his point coons the core issue here is what reasonable prospect do you have for these gauzy benchmarks and timelines you suggest to ever actually result in a withdrawal advertisement in iraq there was a modern nation there was a central government there was infrastructure in place in afghanistan there hasnt been a nation in decades and so despite our 10 years of incredible effort we are not succeeding in building a nation as you put it if the benchmark is selfgovernance stability security we had a decent shot blitzer all right coons of that in iraq blitzer i want to odonnell well if you remember when we were fighting the soviets over there in afghanistan in the 80s and 90s we did not finish the job so now we have a responsibility to finish the job and if youre going to make these politically correct statements that its costing us too much money you are threatening the security of our homeland karibjanian were about to wrap up this topic lets just get there real quickly and ask yes or a no answer are is this nation more secure than it was under president bush yes or no coons yes karibjanian today yes or no odonnell no karibjanian ok well move on to our next topic and this question goes to ms odonnell odonnell can i give can i say why i mean we had more karibjanian we no were really odonnell terrorist attacks on our homeland karibjanian sorry but we do need to move on i know that weve said that the statements out in the national media the saturday night live skits are distractions i appreciate that but to the voter in delaware it is the message that they are receiving so we would be remiss if we did not address this issue so the comments that youve made in the past which are in your own words because theyre on the videotape have become the fodder for the late night tv shows you even released an ad that opened up by saying i am not a witch and a local newspaper columnist said that the comments that youve been seemed to be making make delawareans cringe advertisement so what do you say to voters who want the change but are uncomfortable by these remarks odonnell this election cycle should not be about comments i made on a comedy show over a decade and a half ago this election cycle should be about what is important to the people of delaware how were going to get real jobs back to delaware how were going to get our economy back on track how were going to protect our senior citizens and safeguard our social security these are the issues that delawareans are concerned about you know as wolf you can attest i have not welcomed this media attention youve been asking for an interview for quite a long time my priority has been getting back to the delaware voters meeting as many voters going to as many community forums as possible so that we can counter these things odonnell my opponent has said that the statements that we made in our 20s should be off the table and after he made that statement days later he started running ads in his own campaign materials hes going back on his word using those statements to misrepresent my character so again i thank you for the opportunity for the delaware voters to get to know who i am and what im all about because what i can assure them is while i made statements my faith has matured over the years but regardless of my personal faith when i go down to washington dc it is the constitution that i will defend and it is by the constitution that i will make all of my decisions and that will be the standard bearer for every piece of legislation that i will vote on karibjanian mr coons you have a oneminute rebuttal coons i was surprised to see in the newspaper an interview profile of both of us miss odonnells statement pretty similar to what you just heard from her that she would not have her faith be a central driver of her decisions if elected and im interested if we can explore further your suggestion that the constitution would be your guide because im interested in hearing whether its the constitution as passed by the founders the constitution of 1920 1930 the constitution of 1975 the constitution of today because to me protecting a womans right to choose protecting reproductive freedom and making sure that weve got on the record miss odonnells views on things like prayer abortion evolution is important these arent just random statements on some latenight tv show these are relevant to her service in the united states senate what sort of judges she would confirm what sort of issues she would take up im someone who stands firmly behind the constitution as it stands today i respect stare decisis the decided cases the case law that governs the united states karibjanian all right but lets go to the issue of faith and politics because you were a student pastor at yale you also said in an interview once that you thought you would either end up a preacher a professor or a politician youve occasionally been a guest speaker at some of the churches here in our community baptist churches presbyterian churches to name a few so how much of an influence does this faith in your life have on your politics advertisement coons faith is a central part of how my wife and i are raising our three children of why we decide to do the community service and the outreach that we do but ours is a faith that we think a general motivation towards public service towards trying to create a community thats more tolerant inclusive and just and towards the sort of forgiveness healing and reconciliation that we think is the central message of our faith but i also think as someone who has been elected ten years ive learned to reach a balance where my private faith the aspects of my faith that are religious doctrine dont influence the decisions that ive made for the public in my ten years in county office blitzer lets give you a chance to respond to some of the things she said because in a television appearance back in 1998 on bill mahers show you said evolution is a myth do you believe evolution is a myth odonnell i believe that the local i was talking about what a local school taught and that should be taught that should be decided on the local community but please let me respond to what he just said blitzer well let you respond but answer the question do you believe evolution is a myth odonnell local schools should make that decision i made that remark based on blitzer what do you believe odonnell what i believe is irrelevant blitzer why is it irrelevant odonnell because what i would support blitzer voters want to know odonnell what i will support in washington dc is the ability for the local school system to decide what is taught in their classrooms and what i was talking about on that show was a classroom that was not allowed to teach creationism as an equal theory as evolution that is against their constitutional rights and that is an overreaching arm of the government but please allow me at least the full minute to respond to what he said because he said these statements that we made should be taken into consideration when casting your vote so then i would be remiss not to bring up the fact that my opponent has recently said that it was studying under a marxist professor that made him become a democrat so when you look at his position on things like raising taxes which is one of the tenets of marxism not supporting eliminating death tax which is a tenet of marxism i would argue that there are more people who support my catholic faith than his marxist beliefs and im using his own words advertisement karibjanian were going to clarify that blitzer because a lot of people remember because theyve learned in last few weeks you did once describe yourself when you were in college a long time ago as a bearded marxist coons great question wolf i hope folks will go and read the article its an article that i wrote as a senior the day of our commencement speech and the title and the content of that clearly makes it obvious that it was a joke there was a group of folks who i had shared a room with my roommates junior year who are in the young republican club and who thought when i returned from kenya and registered as a democrat that doing so was proof that i had gone all the way over to the far left end and so they jokingly called me a bearded marxist if you take five minutes and read the article its clear on the face of it it was a joke despite that my opponent and lots of folks in the right wing media have endlessly spun this i am not now nor have i ever been anything but a cleanshaven capitalist odonnell well i would i would stand to disagree because first of all if youre saying what i said on a comedy show is relevant to this election then absolutely you writing an article forget the bearded marxist comment you writing an article saying that you learned your beliefs from an articulate intelligent marxist professor and thats what made you become a democrat that should send chills up the spine of every delaware voter because then if you compare that statement to your policies coons if it were accurate if it were true id agree but its not accurate its not true odonnell you said that on msnbc just a few weeks ago you said that on msnbc karibjanian lets go to an issue that you brought up about being schools and this goes to you first mr coons this is the issue of education in our country and in many public school districts all across america as theyre trying to get in accountability in the classroom it is very difficult to dismiss an underperforming teacher because of the stringent contracts that have been negotiated with the individual school districts and teacher unions do you feel teacher unions are too powerful coons nancy one of the things ive complemented both delawares teachers and delawares governor for is their remarkable progress under the race to the top program one of i think the best parts of the obamabiden administrations progress on education i like both the process and the outcome they set a very high bar they offered a federal pot of money that was available or for those states that were willing to make significant changes and delaware and tennessee were two states that made that progress delawares teachers union the dsea came to the table and with the leadership of the governor markell made significant changes things a lot of folks predicted they wouldnt do to embrace charters and to make them more powerful to make it possible for schools that are underperforming to be shut down or restructured and to change a system so that teacher compensation could be tied towards improvement by students in the classroom i think our teachers deserve our support and i think our teachers have a long tradition of contributing significantly not just to educating our children but to building a stronger and better community my own mother and grandmother were school teachers and i deeply respect the hard work that they do advertisement earlier today i was at eisenberg school in new castle because this is national school lunch week the work that our teachers do the work thats done in early education from head start to full day kindergarten through k through 12 education the work thats done here and in other great public universities around the state and country is critical to laying the groundwork for our future and i have no problem with recognizing that the folks who do the hard work the teachers and the paraprofessionals are entitled to a good standard of living are entitled to be able to live a life where they have health care they have a pension and they have job security i do think there are issues that we have to tackle and i think race to the top made significant progress in them in making sure schools are performing as best they can blitzer you have a minute to respond odonnell well if you notice he didnt answer the question as to whether or not he thought the teacher unions were too powerful and thats probably because he got their endorsement i would say that what we need to do especially here in delaware where we spend so much money on education it ends up going to the sixfigure salaries of our bureaucrats and our superintendents not to the teachers in the classroom its appalling that in a state where we spend so much federal and state dollars on education good teachers who want to get extra materials have to do so out of their pocket i have met many teachers ive sat down with them and talked with them about their concerns with race from the top and whether theyre democrat or republican a lot of them express that we are not spending our education dollars appropriately were not helping the classroom and whats going to happen when this race to the top funding dries up we have a broken system especially in wilmington where i live we have an extremely high dropout rate throwing more money on a broken system is not going to work instead what we need to do is sit down and have conversations with the teachers not the unions about what they need us to do to help them in their classroom advertisement blitzer over the years a number of conservatives have proposed eliminating the department of education in washington do you support eliminating the department of education odonnell i dont think that we need to go to that drastic of a step but as i said senator coburn has released a report that shows where millions of dollars in department of education money has been abused thats the kind of stuff we have to stop we also have to make sure that the money we are putting into education does go to the classroom and make them more effective thats something that were ignoring every time that theres a problem we just throw more money in it to appease the special interest groups were not getting to root of the problem and thats what we need to do start getting to the root of the problem which means talking to the teachers and not only that putting the power back to the parents over whether they send their children to school blitzer in a recent survey of 30 industrialized countries the united states ranked 25th in math 21st in science finland was first in math south korea was first in science specifically what would you do to make the united states number one once again in math and science coons great question and as someone who spent 20 years working with a nonprofit foundation the i have a dream foundation that raises money from private individuals and helps provide scholarships for students for teachers and for a college education ive been handson and engaged with some of the toughest schools in america and some teachers who are significantly undersupported by their districts and who needed additional resources to deliver on a promise of an effective education i think theres a significant role though for the federal government in providing financial support and encouragement scholarships for those teachers in sta in science and technology in engineering and math advertisement we need a new generation of teachers who are fully prepared fully qualified to engage their students in the classroom to use the latest teaching tools in media to teach to the standards that no child left behind established and that need to be modernized and made more flexible and responsive and we frankly need to use collaborative learning techniques karibjanian im sorry but were timekeeping here blitzer ill give you a very quick chance to respond what would you do specifically to make the united states number one odonnell again what i would say to improve our education we have to empower the teachers to do what they need to do to be more effective theyre the ones on the first line of defense theyre the ones who have the most influence over our students but we also have to empower the parents so i support charter schools and i support student vouchers or school vouchers so that it gives parents regardless of income regardless of status an opportunity for their students to have a shot at a great education until our public schools do improve blitzer lets switch gears and talk about health care which is such an important issue to millions and millions of americans right now under the new health care law that was recently signed into law by the president children now can stay on their parents insurance policies until the age of 26 people can no longer be denied coverage for preexisting conditions insurers the big insurance companies are prohibited from rescinding coverage if a customer becomes sick and they cant impose any lifetime limits on essential benefits like hospital stays or expensive treatments you say you want to repeal all of that odonnell well first of all no one is disputing that our health care system before obamacare didnt need reform those are very important things that are part of insurance reform not health care reform advertisement in the course of the public debate over health care reform weve begun to confuse coverage with care our goal should be to make health care more affordable even with obamacare our most vulnerable in delaware are still left uninsured and still left without access to quality health care when we passed obamacare we were promised that it would make more people insured well recent cbo reports say that its not its actually causing businesses to drop their policies because compliance standards are so high our laws especially when it comes to health care should not force businesses to break our laws second of all we were promised that more people that health care costs would be lowered it hasnt it has increased health care costs according to recent reports so what i want to do is to fight to fully repeal that so that we can begin to enact real reform and that real reform would include allowing policy portability when you change jobs allowing delawareans to get policies across state lines right now we only have three options thats not right and i would also fight for some sort of tort reform that allowed doctors to not have to worry and practice medicine to prepare for the courtroom as opposed to the examination room but at the same time this tort reform has to protect those patients who are victims of true medical malpractice blitzer you have one minute to respond coons so much to say i support the implementation of the affordable care act i think it made significant advances and you outlined many of them but theres additional investments in the bill to make sure that theres a breadth of coverage to rural areas through the health services corps by recruiting and training a whole new generation of doctors and nurses by expanding support for community health centers and by also improving efficiency of our health care system it makes a landmark investment of 350 million over a decade to try and fight waste fraud and abuse and increase those savings and there were strategic investments in electronic medical systems that would allow electronic medical records to reduce injuries to patients mistaken diagnoses and mistaken treatments advertisement all of these in combination i think argue for extending perfecting and implementing this landmark bill its not perfect there are problems with it but i think rather than turning it back and repealing and going for another year or two of endless partisan bickering this was a critical piece of legislation not a pretty process that passed it but i would stand for it and implement it responsibly karibjanian well were now into part of the discussion on it so let me just ask you then the issue was brought up about malpractice reform and democrats are often accused of being too close to trial lawyers and republicans say thats why that there has not been the opportunity for reform in this area and why it was not included in the health care bill if you were elected would you work to amend that bill to include malpractice reform coons i think it is critical that folks in this country be able to stand up to and take on powerful interests and where individuals are harmed that theyre able to go into court and to seek redress whether theyre harmed by someone who misled them in a securities investment a product that they purchased that hurt them because it wasnt designed or delivered right or a medical procedure that went horribly wrong i dont support putting caps on liability because i frankly think in our current system it is only the threat of a significant recovery that allows protection for consumers for patients for investors i frankly think thats an important part of the american legal system i do think as i just mentioned there are significant advances in this bill that allow us to make health care safer stronger more transparent and if ive got a major concern about this bill its that were going to reduce costs without squelching innovation advertisement delaware and this country has made incredible advances karibjanian it is discussion odonnell it is discussion ok thats what i was trying to ok first of all you say that youre concerned about reducing costs but reports have showed that this health care bill has caused costs to skyrocket second of all you say that it coons i dont know what reports youre reading i havent seen reports that document that odonnell partisan bickering but one out of four democrats have gone on record saying that they oppose obamacare theyve realized that we made a bad mistake and what this bill does is it gives a massive coons and three out of four democrats strongly support it odonnell control over health care coons it does not give massive control odonnell uncle sam has no business coming in the examination room coons to uncle sam over health care odonnell coming between you and your doctor and thats exactly what this bill does coons christine give some concrete example of how thats a great slogan you toss it around everywhere you go how does this bill actually put uncle sam in the examination room between doctors and patients odonnell it dictates what kind of coons and if so why did the organization that fights for and represents americas nurses americas seniors americas hospitals and americas doctors all endorse and support this bill odonnell and many of those branches on the state level including here in delaware have said we dont support what the national office has done advertisement it gives the government the ability to say coons thats not true odonnell what kind of treatment a doctor can and cant do what kind it will fund it forces businesses to have to comply to these standards where many businesses especially here in delaware have said that they cant afford to and its cheaper to pay the noncompliance coons well ms odonnell the state chamber of commerce odonnell and it has also cut this health care bill has cut medicare karibjanian lets get this point out because were down into the last 30 seconds of this discussion coons i was just going to say the state chamber of commerce and christiana care hosted a debate earlier today i was sorry you chose not to join us it would have been great to hear the response of the physicians and the nurses and the hospital administrators to your suggesting that they didnt support a bill they lobbied for crosstalk blitzer i want to be precise on this specific health carerelated issue you oppose the government mandating that everyone must purchase health insurance is that right odonnell yes because were confusing coverage with care our goal needs to be to make health care affordable blitzer all right well heres the question lets say someone decides not to purchase health insurance makes that conscientious decision even though this person can afford to buy health insurance but decided he doesnt want to this person gets critically ill is rushed to an emergency room advertisement should we people who pay for health insurance provide him or her with that kind of treatment or should we kick them out of the emergency room said you made a decision youre not going to get this kind of treatment odonnell if we do the things that ive said that will help to address that im proposing that will help to address the issue of health care then that person can afford to buy a catastrophiconly policy from across state lines theyll be able blitzer well what if the person doesnt want to buy it odonnell well then we have to address that blitzer who should take care of that person in an emergency odonnell we have to address it blitzer would we all of us taxpayers odonnell we have to no we have to blitzer have to pay for that person odonnell anything that they do when they have another bill that they cant pay make them pay it hold them accountable for that karibjanian before or after they get care odonnell but right now right now well thats up to the hospital but right now were forcing them to were forcing them that they have to give care to illegal aliens so this is something that were already doing what im proposing youre also talking about a very small hypothetical using scare tactics to make people support this health care bill what im proposing in the health care reforms that im proposing will help address those situation and help alleviate those situations advertisement blitzer not just a small number odonnell well nobody should be forced to pay for anyone elses health care and thats what obamacare is doing coons and thats whats happening today before the health care reform bill passed all of us who have health insurance who have health coverage have been bearing the costs paying the freight for those who dont have insurance and dont have coverage theyre getting health care through emergency rooms now thats partly why small businesses employers like new castle county have faced double digit increases in our insurance costs year after year and year because thats how we provide care now its inefficient its inhumane and its not effective karibjanian we have to inaudible this issue for now and move on to our next topic odonnell agree with me that obamacare should be blitzer lets move on to immigration right now and this question will be for mr coons a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants you support that right coons no i support a pathway to being here legally and let me take a moment was that your whole question blitzer the question is what is your position on a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants coons weve got roughly 12 million illegal immigrants in the united states today this is a huge problem and immigration is a federal responsibility and i think we should look to the federal government to step up and fix it advertisement the federal government has failed states like arizona like delaware like many others but we need to recognize the situation were in there are whole industries that rely on the labor of those who are here illegally and there is a long tradition of failing to deliver the border security that our country needs the current administration has stepped up and invested millions of dollars in additional troops and additional services additional support at the border my path forward on immigration would be strengthen the borders make it much tougher for folks to come here illegally and increase the penalties when they do second hold employers accountable particularly those who routinely employ folks who are here illegally by giving them real id that can work that is much more difficult to counterfeit and then holding them accountable if they repeatedly violate that by employing those who are here illegally and then allow those who are here illegally and do not commit further crimes to come out of the shadows if they will pay taxes learn english pay a fine say i committed a crime and pay a fine and go to the back of the line behind those who applied to come here legally i would give them a path towards legal residence i think theres more theyd have to do to ever earn citizenship i respect the tradition of those who go and serve our nation overseas for example being offered a chance at citizenship but in my view the pathway im suggesting is one towards legal residence i want to see us focus our resources law enforcement resources on finding and deporting those who pose a real threat to our community as somehow responsible for a county police department ive seen over and over instances where neighborhoods are threatened by people who are here illegally and where the ice does not have the resources to deport them when we deliver them to them that should be our top priority advertisement odonnell again hes back tracking on things that he had said earlier on the campaign trail and i would ask you when you say that you support border enforcement this administration recently stopped the efforts to put a virtual fence on our border when barack obama is standing with you on a campaign trail this friday are you going to tell him that you disagree with him on his immigration reform efforts i believe however that securing our borders should be our first priority before we get into any discussion of whether were going to get social security benefits to illegal aliens america is a magnet for those all over the country who do believe or all over the world who do believe that america does stand as a beacon of hope and justice for the world and therefore i support a legal pathway to those who are coming over here especially for political asylum to seek a better life than they do in our country and to reward those who break our laws is to cheat those who honor them and this is not a message that our federal government should be sending karibjanian lets go into the discussion portion of it because you say that you agreed to the pathway to citizenship odonnell for legal karibjanian but you dont want to provide amnesty odonnell i dont want to provide amnesty karibjanian how can you do one without the other odonnell because what im saying is we have to get rid of all the bureaucratic messes that make the legal pathway difficult but when someone willingly breaks our laws that sends a message that dont worry about the laws that weve set up dont worry about those who are on long waiting lists for political asylum break our laws and well grant you these benefits its sending the wrong message its economically hurting us and its also a national security issue coons ms odonnell patently mischaracterizes her own position odonnell i do support responsible guest worker programs and thats the difference coons if you can reconcile all those comments youre an even more talented reporter than i think you are nancy one of the challenges we face is getting past the endless bickering and the partisan divide on this senator john mccain was someone who before this election cycle had been a real advocate for working with the business community working with democrats in congress to find a path forward as the years and years have rolled by the number of folks who are here illegally and who pose real threats to our community continue to grow and we are not taking the actions we need to take to separate those who are willing to pay a fine to accept responsibility for coming here illegally and begin paying taxes and contributing to our community and the benefits they are earning advertisement i would rather have us begin to provide a path so that those who are here illegally all stand up and take responsibility for that or are deported that way we can make progress odonnell wow he just took a hardline position again i would ask you are you going to tell president obama that that you disagree with him and you think that illegal aliens should be deported but we have to keep in mind that when we tried amnesty in the 80s it backfired it only increased the problem so weve got to address the issue of securing our borders and this is something the president obamas administration stopped this year weve got to secure our borders first and then begin the discussion on guest worker programs and how to eliminate some of the bureaucracies that keep the legal pathway to citizenship so difficult blitzer were going to get to student questions in a moment were going to get to another question that i have but i just want to clarify one thing on the national security front on china which is a huge issue right now in 2006 and correct if im wrong you said that china has quote a carefully thought out and strategic plan to take over america and if they pretend to be our friend its because theyve got something up their sleeve you also said you wish you werent privy to some of the classified information i am privy to id like if possible for you to clarify what you meant odonnell well first of all i was talking about when i was working with the humanitarian group that was going to china we are given some security briefs about chinas position with some potentially hostile nations and some security threats that my clients would be facing advertisement but we do have to look at china because we own they own so much of our debt it prohibits a lot of decisions that we need to make in regard to our foreign policy number one is iran with nuclear weapons china stands in a big way there these gasoline sanctions that we have are not enforced as strictly as they could be because have allies like france and italy participating in the gasoline embargo but then china comes in and swoops all that business we need to be putting sanctions on those chinese companies because right now when it comes iran getting nuclear weapons is our biggest threat to our national security and when we go to china and we say please stop these companies they probably smirk because were not economically in a position to really hold them to that china could be a bigger ally with us in north korea but theyre not theyre not putting the pressure on north korea that they could so first of all we have got to tackle that national debt weve got to stop these things like these reckless spending bills coming from washington that only contribute to further our national debt because it is putting our national security at issue blitzer but on a specific quote that you said that china has a plan to take over america you know about this plan odonnell well they misquoted me at the time i believe but look at whats going on right now monetarily china could take us up over monetarily before they could militarily blitzer you want to quickly respond because i know that we want to get to the students questions coons its hard for me to respond effectively wolf to all the different issues that my opponent has raised in previous statements and ill just let that stand advertisement i dont have any classified information about china or its plans but what i think we really need to focus on in this debate on this particular question is the steady degradation of our security posture in the pacific rim the australian navy engaged in joint exercises with the chinese and specifically excluded us recently a dramatic shift in the australian policy and as the chinese have become economically stronger they are seeking to become militarily stronger theyre pushing the envelope on issues from taiwan to trade to intellectual property it is a profound threat not just to the vitality of our economy and our innovation and our manufacturing businesses but also to our safety and security to have widespread counterfeiting of everything from pharmaceuticals to aircraft parts to garments going on in china without our standing up and fighting against it karibjanian inaudible out of time coons in trade war crosstalk karibjanian were out of time at this point odonnell are you saying that china has a plot to take over america karibjanian were going to close out this conversation and move on to the students questions because we do want to involve the university of delaware students and first up we have a question from a student who brings us the issue of dont ask dont tell begin video clip unidentified male i was wondering if youre planning to inaudible the issue of dont ask dont tell and its possible repeal end video clip karibjanian mr coons your response one minute coons i would move swiftly as a senator to repeal dont ask dont tell i think it is discrimination plain and simple ive met with and spoken to veterans here in delaware whove served our nation honorably for decades several with topsecret clearances but who could do so only at the expense of denying who they were and the relationships that they wanted to have in my view we should be making progress in this country towards recognizing the full range of humane experience and repealing dont ask dont tell to me is an important next step in the civil rights movement odonnell a federal judge recently ruled that we had to overturn dont ask dont tell there are a couple of things we need to say about that first of all judges should not be legislating from the bench second of all its up to the military to set the policy that the military believes is in the best interests of unit cohesiveness and military readiness the military already regulates personal behavior in that it does not allow affairs to go on within your your chain of command it doesnt allow if youre married to have an adulterous affair within the military so the military already regulates personal behavior because it feels that it is in the best interests of our military readiness advertisement i dont think that congress should be forcing a social agenda onto our military i think we should leave that to the military to decide blitzer we have another student question on the issue of embryonic stem cell research and this goes first to mr coons begin video clip unidentified male my question is what are your views on the federal allocation of funds used for stem cell research end video clip coons i would support stem cell research and i think blitzer were talking about embryonic stem cell research coons correct i would support federal funding for medical research that includes embryonic stem cell research i think there are critical advances that are being made and can be made in addressing some of the most difficult diseases that affect millions of americans and i frankly think if it is possible to do so we ought to be investing and making progress in this critical area of research odonnell i think if we took an intellectually honest look at the research thats been put out there you will see that there is incredible advances with adult stem cell research not as much with embryonic stem cell research because that is where this went on in the private sector that is where investors would be putting their money second of all the government the federal government should not be in the business of creating life simply to destroy it and when it comes to the issue of socalled medical waste i would point to a program called the snowflake babies where they have had incredible success adopting these human embryos that are going to be discarded for medical waste where they have given millionsoh im sorryhundreds and potentially thousands of infertile couples the opportunity to have babies it is the snowflake program it is a wonderful program and i suggest everyone take a look at it advertisement karibjanian our next student question brings us the issue of abortion begin video clip unidentified female what is your stance on abortion including in cases of rape and incest end video clip blitzer for you odonnell i believe there has been a profound loss of respect for the dignity of human life and that is reflected in a lot of our policies whether it is cutting taxes exemptions for disabled lowincome citizens in new castle county or with abortion i respect the human dignity on all levels the unrepeatable precious human dignity on all levels and my opponent and others will use the scare tactic about rape and incest when that is less than 1 percent of all abortions performed in america karibjanian mr coons coons i strongly support a womans right to choose it is settled constitutional law it is an important part of our nation and its freedoms i personally am opposed to abortion but i dont think it is my place to put that view on women i think abortion should be safe legal and rare blitzer lets get into some of these issues and then well go back and get some more students questions on the issue of gays serving openly in the united states military almost all of the nato allies allow gays to serve openly in the military israel which has a fine military as you know allows gays to serve openly in the military why specifically do you believe gays should not be allowed to serve openly in our military odonnell because it is a military policy that our military set forth it is the same thing as i said in my remarks about adultery not being allowed in the military it is a military policy that they regulate because they believe that is in the best interest of unit cohesiveness and our effective military blitzer so if the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff says he believes gays should be allowed to serve odonnell if all four blitzer in the military would that be good enough for you odonnell if all four heads if the heads of all four branches of the military said that then it would be up to them not me as a us senator to impose my social agenda whether it is for or against dont ask dont tell advertisement blitzer well what about that what if the chairman of the army the navy the air force and the marine corps their respective chairman said you know what well do whatever the commander in chief tells us to do but we dont think it is a good idea because of these issues that ms odonnell raises unit cohesion and those other issues what would you say then coons one of my real heroes is harry truman harry truman made a very difficult decision to compel the racial integration of the united states armed forces at a point when most of the leaders most of the generals said for exactly the same sorts of reason unit cohesion performance in the battlefield we should not have a racially integrated military that was a brave decision it was an important decision and the ultimate longterm impact has made our united states military one of the most progressive in terms of promotion and advancement opportunities for racial minorities of any organization in our country as you said earlier most of our nato allies have long ago realized that we are giving up on the service of thousands of potential volunteers who could be serving our nation at home and abroad i dont think it makes any sense because of a narrow social agenda to continue to exclude them from open service in our military odonnell mr coons karibjanian our next student question were going towe dontwere not necessarily going to open discussion on that right now because we want to get the student questions in our next student question comes on the issue of campaign finance reform begin video clip unidentified female what is your position on campaign finance reform and what is your reaction to the recent supreme court ruling allowing corporations to donate to political campaigns end video clip karibjanian mr coons you are first one minute coons i think the citizens united decision the decision to which the student is referring was an unfortunate and illdecided decision one that opens the flood gates to increased corporate contributions that could have the unintended consequencei think unintended of the decisionof significantly distorting out electoral process here in the united states and i would support reforms that further disclose who is behind these shadowy groups whether individuals or corporations that are trying to influence our elections by pouring money into it sunshine is the best disinfectant and in politics it is best for us to disclose as fully and as broadly as possible who is making contributions odonnell and yet the legislative efforts to do exactly that has failed to do that the disclose act that you know harry reidwhich hes called my opponent his pethas put out there to do just that has exempt the major corporations from disclosing it instead what these efforts do is only serve to infringe on the first amendment right of private citizens advertisement ill use my own campaign as an example from our fec reports my supporters have been getting harassing phone calls not just from reporters but from all kinds of people who oppose my candidacy they are using intimidation tactics because we are forced to disclose who is contributing to my campaign so this socalled campaign finance reform is exempting the corporations whether on the left or the right it is those who are in washington already those who are over 10 years old who have over a half a million members and who already are playing in the backroom deals so this is a misguided attempt blitzer do the american people have a right to know where all this money in these campaigns is coming from odonnell yes and no i believe that there are ways to do that where we can report to the fec but we dont have to make them public unless there is a question of corruption and then that would prevent a lot of the harassment that my supporters are getting that would prevent a lot of the discussion about our first amendment rights we can disclose that to the fec but they dont have to put it up on a web site that makes anyone vulnerable to further fundraising calls i mean over and over that is a repeated violation in many campaigns not my own but even my own party has said go look on someones fec report and call them up for a donation and ive said absolutely not that is against the law blitzer very quickly odonnell so these socalled disclosure attempts are being abused coons i justthere is so much there wolf i dont know frankly i support full disclosure of campaign contributions as i said before i think it is the best way to ensure that we have got fair open and clean campaigns folks should know who the folks are who are contributing to campaigns it is an important way to hold candidates and elected officials accountable blitzer we have another student question on the sensitive issue of religion in america begin video clip unidentified male in light of the events in the past decade islam has been viewed as a religion for extremists and terrorists where muslims including myself can attest that islam is far from that now recently there has been much controversy over the mosque being built in the vicinity of ground zero and also the florida pastor making outrageous remarks about the koran now my question to you is as senator where is the line between the freedom of speech and the respect of other religions both of which freedoms are found in the first amendment of the constitution end video clip blitzer mr coons coons thats a great questionand a difficult one the florida pastor who caused a lot of outrage by threatening to burn the koran showed a profound misunderstand of the difference between the islamic terrorists the extremists who genuinely attack america and i think deserve our condemnation and the vast majority of muslims who participate in a religion whose fundamental principle is a commitment to peace and embracing the rest of humanity if that florida pastor wanted to make the right point he should have threatened to burn the readings and the teachings of osama bin laden or of other folks who are a part of the islamist extremist groups it is an important challenge a key role of the united states supreme court to continue to draw the line in the first amendment between those who would do the equivalent of calling fire in a crowded theater who would be inciting to attack and riot such as osama bin laden has in some extremist and hateful writings and those who have scripture religious traditions that are deserving and worthy of broad support those are difficult lines to police and thats a central role that the supreme court plays in our democracy advertisement odonnell well i would agree the supreme court has said that there are restrictions on our first amendment rights again you know you cant as you said go into a crowded theater and yell fire you cant stand up on a plane and yell hijack you cant slander and libel someone however where the question has come between what is protected free speech and what is not protected free speech the supreme court has always ruled that the community the local community has the right to decide and then the issue with the 911 mosque thats exactly where the battle is being fought by the community members who are impacted by that and i support that blitzer but the community members have at least the city council the mayor and the representatives the elected representatives support this mosque and community center that is supposed to be built near 911 odonnell and a lot of the people on the ground do not and theyre going to have a lot to face from their constituents and maybe their reelection is even going to be jeopardized blitzer should this cultural center and mosque near 911 be built coons there is already cultural centers there is already mosques in many locations in manhattan and as you mentioned i would defer to the decision of the local land use authorities the folks who were elected by that community to make decisions about where when and how things ought to be built advertisement i dont think it was a wise choice of location but i cant stand here and say that we should prevent folks from practicing their religion anywhere in the united states to say that we will say you cant build a mosque here violates one of our most fundamental principles freedom of religion karibjanian well weve talked about the supreme court and obviously a united states senator has the opportunity to determine in a way the makeup of that court so what opinions of late that have come from our high court do you most object to odonnell oh gosh give me a specific one im sorry karibjanian actually i cant because i need you to tell me which ones you object to odonnell im very sorry right off the top of my head i know that there are a lot but ill put it up on my web site i promise you blitzer well we know you disagree with roe versus wade odonnell yes but that was she said a recent one blitzer well thats relatively recent odonnell she said of late yes well roe versus wade would not put the power sorry its 30 phcrosstalk blitzer but since then have there been any otherlaughter blitzer supreme court decisions odonnell well let me say about roe versus wade roe versus wade if that were overturned would not make abortion illegal in the united states it would put the power back to the states blitzer but besides that decision anything else you disagree with odonnell oh there are several when it comes to pornography when it comes to court decisions not just supreme court but federal court decisions to give terrorists mirandaized rights i mean there are a lot of things that i believe that this california decision to overturn dont askdont tell i believe that there are a lot of federal judges who are legislating from the bench advertisement blitzer that wasnt the supreme court its a lower court odonnell that was a federal judge thats what i said in california blitzer but which supreme court decisions if any do you disagree with coons the most recent one that ive been engaged in weve talked about is citizens united i think the citizens united case takes a sort of logical extension in the law but takes it to a ridiculous extreme corporations really arent entitled to the same free speech rights in my view as people and in delaware americas corporate capital you would think we would be fighting for the rights of corporations but in terms of political contributions the free speech rights of corporations i dont think deserve the same protections as the free speech rights of real living breathing voting humans and so i would disagree with that decision and i would act to try and find ways to limit it narrow it or even overturn it blitzer anything else coons thats the most important blitzer lets take another question from a student on energy right now begin video clip unidentified male my question is where do you think funding should be placed in order to move toward the united states decreasing its carbon program end video clip blitzer mr coons coons well the most effective investment in reducing emissions of co2 and other things that cause greenhouse gas warming is energy efficiency and conservation there was a significant investment in the stimulus bill in getting municipalities local governments the private sector to invest in efficiency and conservation and those are investments that reduce emissions put people to work and can develop cutting edge technologies that make our systems operate better and to reduce not just the emissions but also the operating expenses in new castle county we took 38 million in eecbg grants and combined it with 4 million of our own and retrofit 20 county buildings we reduced our operating costs we reduced our emissions and we ultimately put folks to work here in our own community as you look at those kinds of investments around the country theyre the most important they have the most impact of anything you can do that will actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions theres many more things we need to do to improve the efficiency of operation karibjanian inaudiblecrosstalk coons of coal fire power plants excuse me odonnell well i think the best way to address this that is most relevant to this us senate race is to talk about the issue of cap and trade because the winner of this us senate race can be immediately sworn in and serve it in harry reids lame duck session and vote on cap and trade while i do believe that we have to be good stewards of this earth we dont need to do it at the expense of our citizens and cap and trade will do that whether its farmers senior citizens or realtors who are concerned about its green compliance standards nobody wants this bill this bill is a national energy tax that will ration energy use and increase our utility bills senior citizens are concerned about the cost these new utility bills going up farmers are concerned about the green compliance standards and raised utility bills shutting down their operations and realtors are concerned about the green compliance standards hurting and already hurting housing market but i would have to ask my opponent speaking of cap and trade your family business stands to financially benefit from some environmental legislation under bush karibjanian the minutes up so lets talkcrosstalk odonnell would your business coons a fascinating question that really makes no sense yet so if youd like to better ask the whole question id becrosstalk whats she talking about odonnell id like to know if your family business stands to have a financial gain if cap and trade is passed and if so would you recuse yourself in the lame duck sessions from voting with harry reid coons fascinating question no to the best of my knowledge there is no direct financial benefit and i do think its important for folks in public office to conduct themselves ethically to be transparent and to be accountable for decisions they make and for votes that they cast i am someone who thinks that greenhouse gasses are a concern are a problem for the longterm and i think we need to take steps to rein them in and to deal with the environmental consequences that they might present blitzer well let me ask miss odonnell what evidence do you have that any family business that he has would stand to gain from cap and trade odonnell because they make fuel cells and blitzer whos they odonnell wl gore they make some of the stuff that will be required by these business to regulate cap and trade so blitzer is that true coons thats quite a stretch gore makes over 1000 products it was difficult for me to understand from her question what she was alking about gore is a company that makes lots and lots of products from implantable medical devices to dental floss to some membranes that component parts that go into systems that go into fuel cells fuel cells are not currently fielded broadly in the united states its a cuttingedge technology that some day has the promise of being a significant contributor to making a more energyefficient cleaner transportation future but to me the impact is so distant from any particular proposal on capandtrade it took a couple of minutes to even understand what she was talking about blitzer on this issue of energy lets just wrap up this section with this yesterday the obama administration announced it was lifting the moratorium in deepwater oil drilling in the gulf of mexico do you support this kind of offshore oil drilling odonnell well that has raised the issue of whether or not we support it here in delaware because that move by obama would allow that no i dont want to see oil rigs off the state of delaware advertisement however it should be up to the states to decide and if governor markell and our state legislatures in dover were to pass legislation for that then i shouldnt as a congressman overstep a states right if virginia wants it not only that we have got to begin to wean ourselves off of foreign oil we are dependent on potentially hostile countries like russia and venezuela while our own homeland is rich with natural resources whether its oil or natural gas and there are states that do want to begin exploration alaska virginia we as a government need to support those states who do want it blitzer do you agree or disagree coons i opposed the presidents proposal to open the outer continental shelf off of delaware to oil drilling when it was first made months ago i frankly think that delawares worldclass beaches shouldnt be at risk of being spoiled by oil spills we depend on tourism on our fisheries theres lots of reasons i think it just doesnt make sense for most of the atlantic coast i do think there are natural energy resources in this country we can and should begin to exploit more fully but i would also prioritize investments in alternative energy technologies the university of delaware has long been a world leader in solar power for example and has a key role to play in making wind power real offshore wind power solar power these are the sorts of initiatives ph where id prefer to see federal investment and new innovative opportunities that could create good jobs for the long term karibjanian lets leave time to throw in one more issue here before we go to closing statements we are kind of drawing down on time this is an issue that i think can really illustrate the differences perhaps between the two of you and that is what specifically would you and could you do to actually help end any of the bitter partisan bipartisan nonpartisanship in washington so what would you be able to do as an individual once you arrive in washington advertisement odonnell well ive had to fight my party to be here on this stage to win the nomination and to some extent i am still fighting my party so my when i go to washington my allegiance will be to the voters of delaware not any special interests my whole campaign has been about returning the political process back to the people of delaware and to me thats a great thing so what i would do is i would stand strong on legislation that benefits the interest of our citizens not the special interests in washington dc and i would stand there and not just vote against a piece of legislation but make the floor speeches that would try to convince my colleagues on both sides of the aisle whove lost their way and given into partisanship so much that it has caused several stalemates as to why this is in the best interests of their constituents and i would stand firm regardless of what kind of pressure was on from either party to stand firm in doing what is right for the people of delaware not the interests in washington coons i frankly dont think my opponent can or has pointed to one single example where she supports the current administration or an initiative of the democratic party i have a real practical record of having reached bipartisan solutions here in county government of working with the elected republicans whove served with me on county council and on council while ive been county executive ive got a real handson record here in the private sector and in my service and partnership with the private sector of reaching out to folks from different political backgrounds from different experiences and from different worldviews to work with them to find solutions i think thats the kind of record that delawareans will look at in judging whether or not ive got the capacity to address some of this endless partisan bickering blitzer well on this specific issue and ms odonnell raised it earlier ill give you a chance to clarify to explain she says that harry reid the senate majority leader has called you his pet coons i dont know why harry reid said that im nobodys pet im going to be a bulldog for delaware im running to represent all delawareans of whatever party not just the democrats and ive got a significant amount of support from independents from republicans from democrats from all three counties advertisement ive got a record of independence and of fighting for the public interest as county executive and i would continue that in washington blitzer and just to clarify another point odonnell well then why blitzer from earlier just to make sure we tie this up earlier you said you didnt want to have to talk about comments you made years ago about witchcraft and stuff like that but in this commercial thats so widely seen you begin the commercial with the words i am not a witch what were you thinking odonnell put it to rest blitzer what were you thinking odonnell to put it to rest to put it behind me blitzer but didnt you realize if you do that in a commercial it would just revive it and everybody would be talking about that odonnell no were moving past that and were talking about the issues id like to address what my opponent just said about being a bulldog for delaware yet in a fundraising letter he promises to support the reidobamapelosi agenda lockstep and barrel sic thats not nonpartisanship and again why are the why is the democratic party pulling out all of the stops to get him elected because they see him as a rubber stamp for their agenda and there are many things that i have publicly said that i support the obama administration on i support obamas decision to send troops to afghanistan i support obamas decision for drones i support obamas decision to treat the american who is recruiting terrorists on american soil who is hiding in yemen i support the decision for our intelligence agencies to do whatever it takes to take him out advertisement so there are things that i would proudly support when it is in the best interest of delawareans but i believe that a lot of the policies coming from this administration are not in the best interest of delawareans and most of them are the failed stimulus bills where weve been promised one thing and then received another but breaking promises is something that my opponent is very comfortable doing karibjanian but even local party leaders have questioned you candidacy especially after the primary and you criticized the man you beat in that primary for being someone who went with what he felt was in the best interests of delawareans for being someone who was borrowing republican principles but going with the democrats so how can you rationalize odonnell what i did in the republican primary and what i will continue to do is bust up the backroom deals we have a lot of our leaders have an obnoxious sense of entitlement about who should get in office and who should represent them on the ballot karibjanian ok odonnell what my campaign did is put the karibjanian i need to interrupt just because we have to get to the closing statements odonnell ah ok blitzer all right lets and we will begin the closing statements both of you will have a chance to make your final comments well begin with ms odonnell odonnell thank you once again id like to thank the host of this debate and nancy and wolf and i hope now that the delaware voters better understand the clear choice we face in november my opponent has a record of raising taxes and a record of wasting wasteful spending like so many career politicians he says he would do one thing and then only breaks his promises after he has assumed office my opponent will rubber stamp the same failed policies that have caused unemployment and our national debt to skyrocket advertisement he is in lockstep with barack obama and harry reid and thats why harry reid has called him his pet im not a democrat but i know that what is happening in this country right now is not what my democratic friends voted for when they voted for change in 2008 what washington needs now are new voices and new ideas that look to the people and not to the government for the solutions to our economic problems my opponent is addicted to a culture of spending waste fraud and abuse whether its spending tax dollars on mens fashion shows or to pay off his cronies with sweetheart pension deals and special interests we already have enough politicians in washington like that i want to go to washington and be the voice of the people of delaware not any party of special interest group i want to go to washington and represent the people who put me on the stage tonight and who are willing to work hard to get our country back on track again its not going to be easy but i do believe that america is the greatest force of good in the world and i had nev

politifact12627,1,trumps tough talk on hedgefund taxes doesnt match his plan donald trump said hedge fund guys are getting away with murder when he called for ending a lucrative tax advantage for investment managers but his published tax plan would give them an even bigger break trump the presumptive republican nominee for president has called for abolishing the special tax treatment that applies to carried interest the share of investment funds profits that are paid to fund managers currently carried interest is treated as capitalgains income which makes it eligible for a tax rate as low as 238 percent much lower than the current top individual income tax rate of 396 percent but the plan published on trumps website would also create an entirely new tax rate just 15 percent for individuals who get income from business partnerships that category includes most managers at hedge funds privateequity funds and venture capital funds in other words if trumps proposals came to pass many investment managers tax rates would go from 238 percent to 15 percent hed be doing me a favor said scott fearon the president of crown capital management a hedge fund and investment fund in greenbrae california hed be cutting my taxes quite a bit spokesmen for trumps campaign didnt respond to requests for comment in emails and telephone calls on sunday trump said on abcs this week that if hes elected he expects his tax proposals would change during negotiations with congress ultimately tax rates for high earners might be higher than he has suggested he said but hed try to preserve proposals to lower taxes on the middle class and on businesses he didnt mention his partnership proposal specifically i will try and keep everything trump said what i really want is lower on business because business were the highesttaxed nation in the world and i want lower on the middle class trumps position on hedge fund taxes resurfaced thursday when he named steven mnuchin a hedge fund manager to lead his national fundraising trump a billionaire businessman and former realitytelevision star had been largely selffunding his campaign mnuchin declined to comment on trumps attacks on carried interest and hedge funds but he said hes already gotten calls from fellow hedgefund managers and others on wall street expressing their support for the candidate rate cut some analysts have pointed out previously that the plan on trumps website would actually benefit investment managers the urbanbrookings tax policy center found that under trumps plan carried interest would be taxed at a much lower rate than under current law alan viard a tax policy scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute said of trumps proposal its clearly a taxrate cut for private equity hedge funds and venture capital trumps 15 percent rate would apply to socalled passthrough business structures including partnerships limited liability companies and sole proprietorships for tax purposes such businesses pass their earnings through to their owners who then pay tax at rates that reach 396 percent under current law saying the current system stifles small businesses the campaign has pitched its 15 percent rate as a boon for them trump also has proposed a top income tax rate of 15 percent for large corporations which currently are subject to a top statutory rate of 35 percent and he has called for cutting individual incometax rates across the board as well taking the top rate from 396 to 25 percent debt increase while trump has proposed limiting the value of certain individual tax deductions to help pay for those cuts various analyses suggest his plan would reduce federal revenue by about 10 trillion over its first decade while it would improve incentives for us taxpayers to work save and invest it could increase the national debt by almost 80 percent of gross domestic product by 2036 unless its accompanied by large spending cuts according to the tax policy centers analysis the broad language of trumps proposed 15 percent tax rate for passthrough partners will get investment managers attention said bill burnham the founder of inductive capital a hedge fund and investment firm in reno nevada you can bet your last dollar that every hedge privateequity and venturecapital fund under the sun would pass through as much income as they could burnham said but he also said the proposal to treat small businesses the same as giant privateequity and hedge funds seems like a big loophole that would quickly close at some point candidates calls bashing carried interest emerged as a popular theme in the 2016 presidential campaign democrats hillary clinton and senator bernie sanders of vermont joined trump in calling for its end as did former republican contenders senator ted cruz of texas and jeb bush hedge funds investment pools open only to wealthy investors engage heavily in shortterm trading and tend to have shorterterm gains that means their carried interest often doesnt qualify for the 238 percent rate which is reserved for gains on assets held for a year or more by contrast privateequity funds put money into longerterm investments trumps proposal to abolish the current treatment of carried interest is aimed at speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital which may not include privateequity funds regardless both types of funds would be in line for the proposed 15 percent rate under trumps proposal but that doesnt mean the candidate wont change it as far as donalds plan its not a plan without far more details said entrepreneur mark cuban the owner of the dallas mavericks basketball team and a star of abcs shark tank television program these are talking points nothing more

thats been made this week particularly in in the house and that would be on afghanistan last year 32 democrats voted against the funding of the war in afghanistan this year 102 democrats voted against that seems to be a dramatic rejection from the presidents own party of his major strategic goal pelosi well not quite you have to put the votes in perspective our president came in he was president maybe two months three months by the time we took the vote last year and the republicans said they werent going to vote for the funding and so it took all democratic votes i persuaded my members to give this president a chance to give him room in order to have time to implement his plan and in and in the course of time now the republicans said they would vote for it it gave my members the freedom to express themselves on the war in afghanistan amanpour now you didnt vote pelosi no amanpour i know the speaker doesnt have to vote pelosi right amanpour but how would you have voted pelosi well we brought the bill to the floor and that was a statement that said that we knew that our troops needed to have what was what they needed to have would be provided for them so we will never abandon our men and women in uniform on the other hand it gave our members a chance to express their view amanpour how long do you think you can keep your skeptical members as you call them on side pelosi well again we have a varying degrees of expression here we are there weve taken an oath to defend the constitution and therefore the american people and thats what people will be looking at how does this figure into our protecting the american people is it worth it amanpour well is it worth it pelosi yes amanpour is it worth it pelosi thats the question amanpour but thats my question to you pelosi well we will as i said we will see the metrics as they unfold in the next few months and certainly by the end of this year amanpour but what does your gut tell you pelosi in my visits to afghanistan the last time i was there was over mothers day weekend to visit the troopsand the four metrics that we have always used year in and year out on these visits have been about security and the military tells us this cannot be won militarily solely secondly governance and ending corruption amanpour im just trying to figure out for instance you know what you think is the right thing to do in afghanistan at the moment look time magazine this week has this as its cover a girl whose had her nose and ears cut off by the taliban you know to put it right down to its basics is america going to abandon the women of afghanistan the people of afghanistan again pelosi well first of all were in afghanistan because its in our strategic national interests to be so for our own national security to stop terrorism to increase global security the women of afghanistan have been a priority for many of the women in congress and men too but the women have taken a special interest when i was there in around mothers day i went to a province in southern afghanistan and visited with women and we talked about the education of their children the health of women and the rest and they especially their daughters they said we want that but that cant happen without security and these women in this remote province told us and that cant happen without the end of corruption so what we would like to see is for president karzai be a more reliable a stronger partner ending the corruption increasing improving the governance amanpour vice president biden talking about the dead line for the transition which is summer of 2011 he said on this program a week or two ago that theres going to be a drawdown of forces biden sotit could be as few as a couple thousand troops it could be more but there will be a transition does that square with with what you think that it could just be a couple of thousand troops pelosi well i hope it is more than that i know its not going to be turn out the lights and lets all go home on one day but i do think the american people expect it to be somewhere between that and a a few thousand troops amanpour lets go to something much closer to home right now at the moment and that is the ethics conundrum with representative rangel how does your affection and your respect for him as a colleague square with whats going on right now and what you said and declared that this is going to be the the the most ethical congress that youre going to drain the swamp of any kind of wrongdoing and corruption etc pelosi when i came in i said were draining the swamp and we did we have passed the most sweeping ethics reform in the history of the congress any personal respect and affection we may have for people makes us sad about the course of events but we have to pull the high ethical standard and none of our personalities is more important than that amanpour can you see congressman rangel ever returning as chairman of the ways and means or in any position of leadership in in the house pelosi well the the ethics committee is working its will and amanpour no matter what happens pelosi its an elementary discussion because what we have done is to wait and see what the committee decides i respect what they do im totally out of the loop it is independent it is confidential classified secret whatever we dont know what it is but we do respect the work that the members of the committee do amanpour let me ask you about the midterm elections you are by all accounts one of the most if not the most powerful and successful speakers of in the history of the united states youve passed so much legislation the president was elected with a significant majority you had control of both houses of congress and yet now people are talking about you might lose your majority in the house the gap seems to be growing wider between whats achieved and whats making an impact with the people how did this happen pelosi well thats one version of the story and crosstalk from outsiders perspective
