gossipcop-938524,1,three hard lessons about addiction we learned after mac millers death the tragic death of mac miller on sept 7 widely assumed to be from an overdose has provoked a muchneeded conversation about how our culture thinks and talks about addiction and recovery its a conversation that was already happening following demi lovatos overdose in july and while the two incidents sparked largely supportive reactions with the rap community and beyond spending the week mourning millers passing the two incidents werent without ugly social media comments and illintended media coverage in one article lovato was blamed for surrounding herself with enablers before her overdose and in the days after millers death his exgirlfriend ariana grande was hit with social media harassment blaming their breakup for his relapse a claim perpetuated by some media coverage of his death that claimed his substance abuse issues became more challenging after their split in lovatos statement following her overdose she described addiction as an illness that is not something that disappears or fades with time and in the aftermath of millers death other facts about addiction deserve to be revisited a reckoning thats essential for our society to better understand people recovering from addiction and to help others get the treatment they need need a break play the usa today daily crossword puzzle millers death was not a selfish act one of the most harmful beliefs surrounding addiction and suicide is that a person is selfish for dying from an overdose or intentionally taking their own life with miller fans taking to reddit to bemoan online commenters calling his death a selfish act blaming him for his death incorrectly reduces addiction to an issue of personal willpower in reality addiction is a disease exacerbated by a social climate that doesnt adequately support recovery from the stigma that addicts face to a general lack of mental health resources millers addiction and death are not ariana grandes fault miller isnt the only one being blamed for his death exgirlfriend grande experienced a rush of harassment blaming her for his passing prompting her to turn off her instagram comments and go silent on social media for days after his death as much pain as millers family friends and fans may be feeling after his death directing that anger at grande is unfair perpetuating the myth that someones addictionrelated death is the fault of their loved ones who maybe couldve saved them had they behaved differently grande has previously spoken about the shaming shes received about millers addiction and recovery posting a lengthy statement in may in response to a fans tweet blaming her for miller getting a dui i have cared for him and tried to support his sobriety and prayed for his balance for years she wrote but shamingblaming women for a mans inability to keep his expletive together is a very major problem i will continue to pray from the bottom of my heart that he figures it all out and that any woman in this position does as well grandes statement gets at an important point that theres a temptation to blame the people surrounding someone who dies of addiction particularly the women in their life rather than offering compassion recovery shouldnt have to be a silent struggle grande makes another important point in her statement about the years she suffered in silence while supporting miller as he battled his addiction writing of course i didnt share how hard or scary it was while it was happening but it was while drug use often shows up in the lyrics of rap and hiphop songs young stars often fight the disease of addiction in silence of course stars arent obligated to go public about their struggles with drugs and alcohol with many choosing to navigate their journeys of recovery in private yet treating addiction as a sinful taboo rather than an issue that can be managed with treatment like any other serious disease only makes it more difficult for people to seek the resources they need to recover following millers death multiple stars came forward with their own stories of addiction and sobriety one of the most compelling tributes came from macklemore who like miller has been open about his struggles with substance abuse writing in an instagram caption that he and miller shared the same disease a disease that is out to kill us and when left untreated eventually will in his post he urged readers not to be ashamed to seek treatment rather than struggling in silence on the surface people that appear to have it all are not exempt from the gravity and cunning nature of this disease he wrote if youre in the midst of addiction tell someone whats going on dont be a secret go to a 12 step meeting introduce yourself and youll be greeted with love and understanding from people that are fighting the same battle although millers admirable openness about his addiction may not have been enough to help him overcome it he and macklemore and the stars who all have shared their own recovery journeys with fans have helped dispel some of the shame that surrounds the issue if you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse or addiction you can call the substance abuse and mental health services administration national helpline at 800662help 4357 any time of day or night
gossipcop-1099516198,0,an exhaustive photo breakdown of the jennifer lopezalex rodriguez courtship whether you call them jrod or alo its become impossible to ignore how aggressively out here this new celebrity couple is lets dive in by april 3 2017 was in many ways an unremarkable earlyspring day baseball season began in earnest charo was eliminated on dancing with the stars but everything changed when alex rodriguez and jennifer lopez hit the streets of new york to film a scene for their shotbyshot remake of american hustle she was amy adams he was christian bale bradley cooper robert de niro and jeremy renner all at the same time getty images ill return to this photo in a moment but first context after one short month of public dating jrod or alo or loriguez or rodpez whatever you want to call it are carrying themselves as if theirs is the most important celebrity romance in the world and it may be they are all the way out here baring midriff carrying notebooks pointing like goddamn maniacs how did we get here lets do what any good gossip cop would do establish a timeline and subject paparazzi photos to extreme scrutiny if alex rodriguez had jennifer lopezs love and she gave him all her trust would he comfort her were about to find out love is thorny friends sometimes it shows up when youre least expecting it like less than a month after youve announced your breakup with silicon valley ceo anne wojcicki sometimes it comes at an inopportune time like a month before drake raps about drunktexting you that was the state of affairs earlier this year us weekly reported that lopezs relationship with drake had ended after two totally not fake months in early february rodriguez announced his monthsearlier split with wojcicki on february 25 and then this from page six delivered on march 8 2017 as if one of cupids arrows call them jrod or is it alo famous baseball player alex rodriguez and famous singer and actress jennifer lopez had apparently been dating for a few months and wed been none the wiser but the proof was incontrovertible page six also reported that lopez liked one of arods instagram posts and that rodriguez had been blown away by lopezs onewoman revue in las vegas which he saw with his friends by march 11 three brief days after this couple forced new yorks most august gossip institution to ponder portmanteau things had gotten serious i know this because they were photographed together on a boat and you dont take a casual fling on a boat especially not to the bahamas that was saturday the following morning lopez was flush with the kind of romantic feeling you get only from having spent the weekend at bakers bay golf ocean club which provides an unforgettable bahamian experience so she decided to let the world know via instagram the intimate social media network where she has 621 million followers in lopezs grainy selfie added to her instagram story shes front and center wearing a contented expression i can describe only as radically postcoital behind her right ear rodriguezs face is visible but obscured hes playing with her hair or maybe nibbling on her ear he looks like a clown its incredibly sweet lopez quickly deleted the post but not before broadcasting it to some portion of her follower base the size of the united kingdom give or take a few million people the game was on later that week the couple was photographed separately on their way to dinner together in miami they wore coordinated very miami outfits jennifer lopez and alex rodriguez stepped out for a romantic date night in miami httpstcotmq2rro9yv pictwittercom48atsmlhto entertainment tonight etnow march 17 2017 if it was not clear before this dinner that jrod i like this name better than alo was well on its way to being the most endearing and also terrifyingly powerful celebrity couple on this green earth it was certainly clear the next day when the pair decamped to noted hotspot george m steinbrenner field in noted love nest tampa florida to quietly drop in on new york yankees spring training rodriguez despite his rocky tenure with the team is now a special instructor in pinstripes in this photograph presumably taken by drone or falconmounted camera alex rodriguez is wearing timberlands while jennifer jenny from the block lopez sports a yankees cap lets get loud at spring training jennifer lopez supported alex rodriguez at the yankees training camp in tampa httpstco2ukfm2w6bl pictwittercoml8qwq0gbt2 e news enews march 19 2017 these two are feeling themselves and also preening for each other why would you wear wheat timbs the official shoe of the bronx per desus and mero in 77degree weather if not to prove to the queen of the borough that you can keep up we didnt hear from jrod for a week or so after that beyond this instance of rodriguez laughing inappropriately intensely at dinner with lopez to this point wed seen the two only from a maximally voyeuristic distance hazy pap shots shortlived instagram photos separate images of them on the way to dinner together and then they went to marea the central park south italian joint popular among hedgefunders it was the most majestic coming out for a celebrity couple since jenny slate and chris evans hit the premiere of the secret life of pets they spent nearly three hours sampling the finest seafood and pasta perhaps even both at the same time im told the fusilli with octopus and bone marrow at marea is excellent but dont get excited yet as notable and exciting as a night of upscale italian sounds its nothing compared with what happened next the very next day they went to marea again for lunch a reasonable assumption jennifer lopez and alex rodriguez love marea which in 2009 the new york times called as welcoming as a luxe clubhouse and wherein 2017 the business lunch primo and secondo can be had for 52 do you think they had the fusilli with octopus and bone marrow twice in 24 hours i think they did because how could you not and though im concerned about jrods commitment to a healthy diet i am extremely not concerned about how unbelievably in sync these two are getty images theyre on fire guys extremely welltailored beige fire lets go to the tape lopez is wearing some sort of 22ndcentury camel coat carrying what i imagine is a very expensive purse and wearing some serious hoop earrings but the best thing shes wearing is her look she is fixing her man with a fullon love smirk she is extremely proud to be on the arm of the most successfully rehabilitated steroid offender in baseball history exiting a restaurant where the waitstaff knows better than to seat titans of finance and assholery bill ackman and carl icahn next to each other rodriguez meanwhile is crushing the khaki suit a look even the only cool american president ever struggled to pull off he owns a fancy umbrella the kind with a wooden handle and hes holding it with both hands the umbrella suggests its raining which means theres no excuse for his seemingly suede shoes hes studiously looking away from the paparazzi which good play it cool al amateur forensic gossip pathologists will note that rodriguez is not really covering lopez at all with his umbrella im willing to concede the charge but ill also point out that rodriguez is a worldhistorical narcissist a tremendous weirdo whose face my colleague katie baker recently described as that of a man who has always longed to be a real boy he spent an entire career as the galactically talented oddball in every locker room he called home tanked his reputation by lying about his steroid use over and over and only recently emerged as a wellloved studio analyst better at breaking down swing planes than making polite conversation of course hes not sacrificing his outfit for his lady alex rodriguez doesnt know how to do that and heres the important thing jennifer lopez does not care one bit that her boyfriend is being an umbrella jerk perhaps like the lonely band of pariahloving baseball fans that have always rooted for him she has determined that arod is secretly charming and perhaps shes ascertained that arod is magnetic precisely because hes so selfinvolved she has unlocked the arod code she knows that this man who took this photo and owns a painting of himself as a centaur just cant get out of his own way all of which is to say find yourself a partner who looks at you the way jennifer lopez looks at alex rodriguez when he fails to cover her with an umbrella as they exit an italian restaurant that will wreck your expense account where do you go once youve summited celebritycouple mount olympus you take a page from the taylor swift playbook and meet mom of course shortly after their lunch lopezs mother guadalupe rodriguez joined them for a stroll around new york guadalupe was skeptical at first but she came around by the end of the day jennifer lopez introduces her new bf alex short details jenn see full details httpstcob9ejbs6lktalexrodriguez pictwittercomij4skgcrii ade adefalujo adelovecom april 4 2017 which brings us to monday april 3 the day lopez and rodriguez stepped out looking like hightest extras from a scorsese movie tmz reported that rodriguez asked lopez to join him at a business meeting citing her business acumen dont be distracted by what arod is doing from a business standpoint which is apparently building something called arodcorp atop a portfolio of real estate development auto dealerships highend fitness centers and logoed polos the only thing that matters here is that citing business acumen is the most romantic thing ive ever heard april 3 is now a national holiday but we can go deeper this daily mail video of their exit reveals a large multicolored 8 12 painted on one of the buildings groundfloor windows that numeral is the logo for brasserie 8 12 a restaurant located in the solow building on west 57th street the private equity firm sportswear holdings ltd has a penthouse office in the solow building sportswear holdings specializes in the leveraged buyout of fashion companies like tommy hilfiger and michael kors lopez sells her jennifer lopez collection at kohls she is extremely well positioned to give advice about a fashion venture rodriguez owns urns produced by the fashion designer rick owens and recently brainstormed arodcorp hats and polos perhaps rodriguez and lopez were discussing an apparel venture with a company that specializes in such matters or perhaps im off the mark and they were meeting with generic rich people about generic richpeople things either way i will bet my life on the occurrence of the following chain of events that after leaving this meeting at 9 west 57th st looking like the maddest man and sexiest carmen san diego alex rodriguez and jennifer lopez trekked half a mile to 240 central park south there the matre d greeted them by name and led them to their favorite table at their favorite restaurant in the

gossipcop-888478,1,nia jax on promoting a positive body image in her return to total divas nia jax is not like most girls and wouldnt have it any other way an imposing figure in the ring the wwe superstar walks confidently down the aisle before every match the strength she exudes combined with overall selfassuredness have made her a role model for those who might find it difficult to embrace who they are in life jax is cognizant of this which is a reason she signed on to join the total divas cast last year the e reality series became a way for her to show different sides even the insecurities the raw performer believed it was a chance for audiences to get a better glimpse who she is as a person coming on to the wwe scene i was different and bigger than everybody so everyone didnt know how to take me she said i could tell fans were like well she is supposed to be a bad guy do we hate her do we make fun of her because of her size she does some cool things the other girls cant do do we cheer that im bubbly i m loud i like to have fun i am always down for a party and if there is drama i like to nip that in the bud i feel like it opened myself to our current wwe fans to see what my personality was off camera then the new fans on total divas who see me as a different person a breath of fresh air and something they dont see on tv as often a bigger girl kind of embracing herself and really living life without any apologies it has been great i love being part of total divas i love our cast its a different cast this year but last year i loved the cast as well i had a great time filming i feel like this season is probably our best season yet jax could feel a genuine appreciation for her positive message on social media and during appearances she returned to the plussized celebration known as curvy con for a second time with fellow total divas cast member nikki bella who was the first straightsized women invited to the event the two took the main stage to discuss body positivity and the importance of supporting each other on their respective journeys its a party of encouraging inspiring women jax said it has a lot to do with fashion but it has a lot to do with encouraging people to be themselves last year i was on such a high from it that i remember talking to nikki bella and brie bella and saying you guys need to come here they were starting their birdiebee line and including plus size i told them they needed to bring a popup shop to curvy con because you dont understand the reach that it has its during new york fashion week which is huge but the impact that it has on women this year when i got to do it with nikki by my side it was on another level we got to be on a panel it was so cute because we were backstage and nikki said im so nervous i said why would you be so nervous she said it was out of her comfort zone it was an honor to join such influential people like venus williams and gabourey sidibe there jax was also grateful to receive a peoples choice nomination for game changer of the year and recently accepted the association of national advertisers seeher now award her drive and passion to put good in the world is likened to cousin of dwayne the rock johnson she hopes to continue being an example for season eight of total divas for jax having cameras around the second time around during taping was easier i became used to it she said even before i was on total divas total divas was filming backstage when i was on nxt i did a breaking ground with nxt as well so i got a little taste of having cameras follow me with the experience of my mom coming to my firstever wrestling match on tv its pretty easy just because i feel like im a pretty cut and dry person you know exactly what youre getting from me i dont change how i am when im on camera than when im off camera it was a little different because i was a lot busier this season when i became the womens champion at wrestlemania obviously when youre the champion there are a lot more things required of you my schedule got busy pretty quickly which i was grateful for however with the cameras there you feel like youre doing three different jobs running at the same time jax is excited for fans to see what winning the title from alexa bliss at wwes biggest event of the year meant to her looking back today she realizes what a huge impact it had when they were approached with a storyline revolving around body shaming and best friend backstabbing jax recalls bliss feeling uncomfortable with some of the things that were written i said to her look this is a huge storyline this is something people go through not just body shaming but body image in general that alexa had to deal with growing up that ive dealt with i feel like everyone has dealt with this at some point we had to go in like really go in on this storyline she said we agreed i told her stuff youre going to say is going to hurt but at the end of the day i feel like this is going to be a bigger thing that we realize talking to fans and fans approaching me to tell me how it really touched them they could relate to what we were going through within the storyline then to see everyone stand behind me when i won the title at wrestlemania it changed my life it completely made me appreciate everything that we got to do it made me realize the platform we do have in wwe and the reach it has im so grateful we were able to tackle that storyline because its something that was real people need to see it people were questioning why we were doing this and saying how dare they have alexa say that i sat back saying yes let her say those things because this is real life it happens we need to tackle it young kids watch our product and theyre going through it to be able to see some of their favorite superstars going through it and then being able to relate i get to beat my bully and win the title at wrestlemania thats the biggest moment in my career so far its really cool rather than finding love and a boyfriend jax says the season centers more on coming into her own and becoming more independent its about winning the womens championship and buying my first house by myself she said welcoming paige back that is a huge thing this season paige had a pretty rough year before she came back she made her comeback got injured again she had to transform into this amazing general manager she is just so incredibly talented i feel like this season you will see a lot of her and i having a lot of fun there is a lot of antics that go on between us thats the first thing we do when we get together it becomes what kind of trouble can we cause or practical joke can we pull now that she is on smackdown we cant pull much but any time there is a combined payperview that is what we do it becomes lets get together and wreak some havoc this season i feel like there is a lot of stuff but my personal favorite is paige is coming back and everyone gets to see the journey she has gone through they get to see how strong she is and all the things she had to overcome to get where she is today jax couldnt be prouder with the recent steps forward taken by wwe for the female roster she has enjoyed watching the second annual mae young classic perhaps scoping out future opponents i saw a little of it because i wanted to hear my renee young and beth phoenix on there jax said im pretty impressed with toni storm i like her style the one football marking she puts under her eye its like she is ready to go she has a cool style about her its so cool to see something like the mae young classic these women are such a diverse group i feel like even in wwe its the most diverse roster it has ever been then to see all these other women just kicking butt these girls are not only working hard in the mae young classic but they are working yearround and get to showcase it here in wwe and the network its so cool to watch because its not only inspiring us to see what is upandcoming with the next generation of wwe but inspires us to get better and continue what we are doing keep pushing on and break the glass ceilings and break the molds and realize that there is no limit to what we can do on the horizon is the inaugural allwomens payperview evolution on october 28 when the announcement was made she had one dream match in mind i thought it would be cool if me and my cousin tamina teamed up against beth and nattie jax said four powerful women and two powerhouse teams against each other after losing the womens championship earlier in the summer jax has been relatively off tv recovering from ailments and training to be back better than ever though viewers didnt have to wait that much longer for the irresistible force to return she began the comeback on raw after hell in a cell teaming with ember moon just in time for the build to the historic allwomens ppv ill be at evolution for sure jax said now people are saying im doing so well i feel i owe it to them to keep it up the pressure i got to go get it back from ronda total divas season 8 premiere wednesday september 19 98c e

though i told them that we had the best security team and it could still go on without a hitch they didnt want 100 million people standing outside trying to take pictures ruining the intimacy and

gowns that were basically ready all the vendors were in place for the big wedding we just didnt have a location in that week we decided we cant do it at a hotel we cant do a venue because people were going to know we limited the guest list to the two families and the wedding party and then we talked to britney and kevin about doing a surprise wedding nobody would know not even britneys mom no nobody knew we told everyone and our vendors we were having an engagement party we tried to use every vendor we could who was going to help at the wedding and you would throw it at your house in studio city well their place wasnt ready yet the vendors made the house look stunning it was so beautiful i only wish they could have had more people every person who walked in that night we handed then an invitation they opened it up and it said surprise you are here for the wedding and not the engagement party and we would direct them to the room where they would change into their gowns and tuxedos tuxedos i thought the men were wearing those white juicy velour jumpsuits no thats what they left the house in they were in tuxedos and gowns everybody made such a big deal about that but

the ultimate location for all fans of the boy wizard and his fellow members of the magic community platform 9 at kings cross station however several locations around kings cross were used for the filming and youll get to visit many of them albeit since the wall that was used as the entrance platform 9 is in fact located between platforms 4 and 5 you will need to gaze at it from the other side of the ticket barriers unless that is you happen to be boarding a train from either of those platforms so as you read this your piccadilly line train from leicester square should just be pulling into kings cross station important there are several exits from the piccadilly line at kings cross so you will need to follow the directions carefully to ensure that you go out of the correct one for the tour directions on arrival at the piccadilly line platform at kings cross station turn right off the train following the platform signs for euston road british library walk to the end of the platform go left through the exit then turn right go up the escalator at the top keep straight and exit through the ticket barrier once through the barrier keep straight ahead and go up the steps at the top of which turn left and then go right through the tunnel following the signs for st pancras international be sure to keep to the left side of this tunnel you will come to a flight of stairs on the left signed stairs to street level go up them and at the top turn left and walk past the boots shop after which go left following the way out euston road sign go right along euston road and just before the red phone box turn right pause by the black lamppost and look across at the large arch of the redbrick building on the other side of the roadway st pancras station kings cross exterior although harry potter and his schoolmates board the hogwarts express at kings cross station the exterior used in the films was in fact the one that now looms over you st pancras station the chamber of secrets it was on the corner of the courtyard to the right of the arch that the weasleys parked the ford anglia in harry potter and the chamber of secrets directions walk towards the st pancras renaissance hotel but do not cross to it instead follow the pavement as it swings right keep ahead the redbrick hotel should be to your left and on arrival at the cobbled roadway look up at the clock tower a great escape in harry potter and the chamber of secrets when harry and ron find themselves unable to pass through the wall on to platform nineandthreequarters because dobbie has sealed it they return to the ford anglia and fly off over the station the clock that towers over you to your right is shown in this flight scene directions cross the cobbled road and head down the flight of stairs behind the three brown bollards keep ahead over the traffic light crossing and on the other side veer left and head for the two large archedwindows with the clock tower over them all of which are clearly visible as you approach you will see the sign for platform 5 although you cannot actually enter through this door you can position yourself to be able to see platforms 4 and 5 and in particular the walls between them the entrance to platform nineandthreequarters kings cross station has appeared in every harry potter film because the journey to hogwarts aboard the hogwarts express starts from kings cross platform 9 which is invisible to the eyes of muggles and which is reached by walking through the wall between platforms 9 and 10 however kings cross station posed a slight problem for the film makers in that platforms 9 and 10 werent actually adjacent to one another the problem was overcome by renumbering platforms 4 and 5 thus platform 9 is in fact situated between these two platforms ahead of you which are separated by brick arches in the harry potter films the hogwarts express pulls into the far end of the platform harry cant get through in harry potter and the chamber of secrets mr and mrs weasley pass through the portal but when harry and ron try to do so they just hit the wall and fall to the ground a nearby porter eyes them suspiciously and asks what they think theyre doing to which harry replies sorry lost control of trolley realising that they cant get on to the platform they hurry back to the forecourt st pancras which you visited earlier and take off in the ford anglia our final glimpse of harry ron and hermione it is on the platforms ahead that we catch our last glimpse of harry ron and hermione in harry potter and the deathly hallows part two when they bring their children here to pass through the wall and onto platform 9 to begin their first journey to hogwarts why j k rowling chose kings cross station kings cross station was a special place for joanne rowling since her parents actually met on a train from kings cross to arbroath so the station always had a special significance for her directions as you face the doors turn left and walk towards the entrance to kings cross st pancras underground station passing to the left of it turn right and enter kings cross station keep ahead passing the ticket office on your right and pass to the right of the sign that reads toilets and baby care and ahead of you under the footbridge you will see an unsightly scrum of people this is the line waiting to be photographed pushing the trolley through the wall at the designated platform 9 platform nineandthreequarters although not an actual film location the brown brick wall to your right has become a magnet to harry potter fans from all over the world they come to photograph the sign which the station authorities have obligingly put up in honour of the stations most famous passenger even more obliging is the fact that they have also taken the trouble of placing a luggage cart against the wall which looks as though it is half way in to the wall as though some young witch or wizard is proceeding on their way to board the hogwarts express sadly if you wish to have your photograph taken here you have no choice but to join the line where the wait can be upwards of 30 to 40 minutes dont be tempted to try and push in as believe you me the combined effects of both the cruciatus curse and the killing curse will pale into insignificance when compared to the cursing that will come your way should you attempt to jump the queue the trolley is under the control of the enthusiastic staff from the nearby harry potter shop at platform 9 shop and they watch over the line with dolores umbridgelike officiousness there is also an official photographer on hand who will snap your endeavours at getting through the wall and you can then purchase your photograph at the shop should you so desire however you can also take your own photos directions continue past platform 9 and a little further along on the right is the harry potter shop the harry potter shop at platform 9 styled to resemble ollivanders wand shop complete with wooden panelling and lots of draws the harry potter shop has something for everyone you can if you wish splash out and purchase exact replicas of the wands used in the films by harry ron or hermione there is a selection of jumpers in the various house colours or you can marvel at a display of horcruxes if your tastes incline more towards the discreet and understated then you can choose from a selection of hoodies in a variety of colours all with platform 9 emblazoned on them and if youre seeking a more modestly priced souvenir then you can plum for a selection of board games key rings mugs soft toys or

prompted jenny lumet an awardwinning screenwriter rachel getting married the mummy the daughter of filmmaker sidney lumet and granddaughter of singeractivist lena horne to pen a response detailing her own experience with simmons on nov 22 2017 russell simmons wrote i have never committed any acts of aggression or violence in my life i would never knowingly cause fear or harm to anyone dear russell i met you around 1987 through rick rubin who has always been kind to me rick knew my sister through nyu and asked me at the upstairs bar in a nightclub called the palladium to be in a movie you were producing that rick was directing starring run dmc it was frankly a lousy movie and i was terrible in it over the next three or four years i would see you out and about at a nightclub called nells mostly i dont recall you and i ever just going out to dinner or having a onetoone experience we were always in groups and we had many many mutual friends you were charming and funny and charismatic and selfdeprecating not being in the music business made it possible for me to relax around you and you were a fan of my grandmother respected her and told me so you seemed sincere you pursued me lightly on and off over a course of years saying you had a thing for a little yellow girl me i rebuffed it wasnt deep as far as i knew it was never a big deal you had i assumed many women in your orbit once you sent me 250 balloons with the note please baby please baby baby baby baby after a character in a spike lee movie it was light fun and flattering we continued to socialize in the same places we continued to have a large group of mutual friends one night circa 1991 when i was around 24 i was at a restaurant called indochine i had worked there when i was 17 as the coat check girl and i enjoyed returning i still knew some of the staff at this point and felt quite comfortable there i remember i was wearing one of the azzedine alaia tops that were everywhere that year and hoop earrings i think it was cool enough for a jacket because i remember being glad i had a jacket by the end of that night you had a car and a driver that evening sometime later you offered me a ride to my home i said sure during the making of the run dmc movie i had been in vans with you and other crew members i dont recall having accepted a ride home alone with you before that night at no time that night did i say russell i will go home with you or come home with me or i will have sex with you or i have the desire to have sex with you i believe it was an suv because i recall having to step up into the car i dont know about makes or models i think the driver was already in the car i got into the car with you the driver began to drive i assumed you knew where i lived because you had sent me 250 balloons but i gave the driver my address on 19th street and 2nd avenue you said to the driver no i didnt understand so i said russell i said again to the driver 19th street again you said to the driver no then the car doors locked it was loud the noise made me jump i didnt recognize you at that moment it was disorienting it was disorienting i say it twice now because you said no twice then i couldnt open the doors i couldnt open the windows the car was moving the driver did not stop he did not take me to 19th street he took me to your apartment i didnt try to kick the windows out i didnt punch or kick i didnt say what are you doing my voice left me after the second no i felt dread and disorientation i wanted to go home i said i wanted to go home i didnt recognize the man next to me i didnt know if the situation would turn violent i remember thinking that i must be crazy i remember hoping that the russell i knew would return any moment the car stopped at the curb i dont recall the street i recall the driver opening the door from the outside and you behind me i was between the two of you not wedged just in the space between you i remember exchanging a look with the driver he was unreadable it was chilly out it was me and these two men i felt dread i was tremulous off my feet i felt an intense need to keep both of you calm was there a time or a space to run i have no idea would somebody else have run i have no idea there were two men one of whom obeyed the other it was an overwhelming feeling there was no welllit lobby or doorman at the entrance we used i would guess it was not the main entrance to the building i believe there was a door from street level that opened into a space beneath the residential area of the building in which there was a small back elevator if i am wrong about the layout then i am wrong there were two men and i was afraid you didnt punch me drag me or verbally threaten me you used your size to maneuver me quickly into the elevator i said wait wait i felt dread i was very very sad i didnt know if the driver was a further threat or an ally i was both relieved and terrified when he did not get into the elevator alone in the elevator you pressed me into the corner with your body your hands and your mouth the elevator did not stop on the way up to your apartment i was moved very quickly inside i recall hearing the apartment door closing behind us i saw no one else i recall you were behind me i was still hoping the russell i knew would reappear as i could not recognize the man moving me deeper into the apartment the man who had said no to his driver twice you moved me into a bedroom i said wait you said nothing i made the trade in my mind i thought just keep him calm and youll get home maybe another person would have thought differently or not made the trade it was dark but not pitchdark you closed the door at that point i simply did what i was told there was penetration at one point you were only semierect and appeared frustrated angry i remember being afraid that you would deem that my fault and become violent i did not know if you were angry but i was afraid that you were i desperately wanted to keep the situation from escalating i wanted you to feel that i was not going to be difficult i wanted to stay as contained as i could you told me to turn over on my stomach you said something about a part of my body you did not ejaculate inside me when it was over i got my clothes and quickly went down in the elevator by myself you didnt try to stop me i went home in a taxi i was grateful to be secure in my home i never told anyone this story until october 27 of this year after the harvey weinstein story was in the news but weeks before the first public claims were made against you when i told a girlfriend from childhood abusing women in any way shape or form violates the very core of my being russell simmons we encountered each other socially many times after that night we had a score of mutual friends we may have been photographed proximately or together the dynamic between us was different muted i never sought you out nor did i run from a place or event upon seeing you i feel confident in saying we nodded at each other said hello i strove for an affect of normalcy and i never said anything to you about that night you have never said anything to me specifically we saw each other at the vanity fair party after the academy awards in 2005 the year my father won the lifetime achievement award i saw you again at the naacp image awards briefly in 2009 i believe you were there with your daughters we both accepted awards that night i encountered you at a party in los angeles before the 2011 academy awards during which there was a planned tribute to my grandmother who had just passed away these were events that were supposed to be happy and they were tainted i dont recall ever meeting any of the women who have spoken out against you russell but i cant leave those women twisting in the wind maybe the recalling of this incident can be helpful i dont know if it can i have built a life in the past 25 years and a reputation in my industry i need no one to have this visualization of me i will like the others lose work because of this i realize how privileged i am to be able to risk that i have children im aware that every mistake act of thoughtlessness hypocrisy or cruelty ive committed in my 50 years will be excavated and theyll see all of it there is so much guilt and so much shame there is an excruciating internal reckoning as a woman of color i cannot express how wrenching it is to write this about a successful man of color again shame about who i was years ago choices made years ago in this very moment i feel a pang to protect your daughters i dont think you are inclined to protect mine in response to this article simmons responded that he is stepping down from his various businesses to commit myself to continuing my personal growth spiritual learning and above all to listening his full statement is below i have been informed with great anguish of jenny lumets recollection about our night together in 1991 i know jenny and her family and have seen her several times over the years since the evening she described while her memory of that evening is very different from mine it is now clear to me that her feelings of fear and intimidation are real while i have never been violent i have been thoughtless and insensitive in some of my relationships over many decades and i sincerely apologize this is a time of great transition the voices of the voiceless those who have been hurt or shamed deserve and need to be heard as the corridors of power inevitably make way for a new generation i dont want to be a distraction so i am removing myself from the businesses that i founded the companies will now be run by a new and diverse generation of extraordinary executives who are moving the culture and consciousness forward i will convert the studio for yogic science into a notforprofit center of learning and healing as for me i will step aside and commit myself to continuing my personal growth spiritual learning and above all to listening
politifact13283,1,warren buffett says the superrich pay lower tax rates than others its not often you see someone stand up and say tax me more yet thats just what famed investor warren buffett has done in an oped in the new york times headlined stop coddling the superrich buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class thanks to special tax categories for investment income while the poor and middle class fight for us in afghanistan and while most americans struggle to make ends meet we megarich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks he writes as an example buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 174 percent while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent averaging 36 percent if you make money with money as some of my superrich friends do your percentage may be a bit lower than mine but if you earn money from a job your percentage will surely exceed mine most likely by a lot buffett wrote to understand why you need to examine the sources of government revenue last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes the megarich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes its a different story for the middle class typically they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot buffetts oped inspired a reader to write to us and ask how buffetts numbers could be correct as our previous factchecks have shown about half of all americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income and when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes its people with higher incomes so we decided to factcheck buffetts statement that the megarich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes the middle class fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot before we get to the heart of the factcheck its best if we review a few basics of the tax code that buffetts oped takes for granted this review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated so bear with us sign up for politifact texts income taxes federal income taxes are progressive which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money lets take a married couple filing jointly as an example in 2011 after deductions and exemptions the income between 0 and 17000 is taxed at 10 percent the income between 17000 and 69000 is taxed at 15 percent the income between 69000 and 139350 is taxed at 25 percent the income between 139350 and 212300 is taxed at 28 percent the income between 212300 and 379150 is taxed at 33 percent the income above 379150 is taxed at 35 percent keep in mind that even if youre in the top bracket of 35 percent you dont pay that tax rate on all your income you pay 10 percent on the first 17000 15 percent on the money between 17000 and 69000 and so on payroll taxes payroll taxes are separate from income taxes if you work for a company your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government these taxes pay for social security and medicare its listed as fica on your pay stub typically workers pay 62 percent of their first 106800 in earnings for social security taxes and they pay 145 percent on all their earnings for medicare hospital coverage the employer has to match those taxes bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 124 percent for social security and 29 percent for medicare last year though president barack obama and congress knocked 2 percentage points off social security taxes for workers as an economic stimulus measure so this year most of us are paying 42 percent while employers pay 62 percent oh and if youre selfemployed you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 104 percent on earnings up to 106800 and 29 percent on all income payroll taxes are not progressive the rates dont get higher the more you earn in the case of the social security taxes which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the 106800 cap head hurt yet ours too taxes on investments okay now were getting closer to buffetts main point here and thats taxes on investments the tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income if you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent the rate for longterm capital gains and qualified dividends some hedge fund managers and other financesector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as carried interest and taxed as a capital gain the wall street journal breaks down how carried interest works in fact some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risktaking and entrepreneurship they also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends we wont settle the argument here but theres no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers getting back to buffetts oped his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other the fact were checking here is that the megarich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes while middle class taxpayers fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot hes right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job very little of this taxpayers income is wage income so payroll taxes dont take much of a bite it seems likely that much of this hypothetical persons income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate and in fact as buffett says statistics from the internal revenue service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent on the other side of the equation people who work for a living especially those who make higher than average salaries get taxed at higher rates it gets a little complicated given how the tax brackets work but basically people who make between 100000 and 200000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes and it goes up from there according to an analysis from the nonpartisan tax policy center buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if youre in the 25 percent tax bracket your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent and the more money you make the more income taxes you pay while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income were dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate as buffett claims someone in his office now pays the top income tax rate is 35 percent but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises which makes it difficult to get above 379 percent according to the people we ran this by at the tax policy center we contacted buffetts offices as berkshire hathaway about this point but didnt hear back one final note people who dont pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes or they qualify for enough deductions think of child tax credits and mortgage interest that they have no income when buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does hes thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries so when it comes to buffetts statement there are two categories the rich and the really rich and the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely welltodo counterparts if their income comes primarily from investments overall we rate buffetts statement true
gossipcop-9659734933,0,angelina jolie shows true colours after brad pitt breakup video image brad pitt begged angelina jolie to wait on divorce 110 theres certainly been quite the uproar since angelina jolie filed for divorce from brad pitt earlier this week thats not exactly how the actor wanted things to go down brad begged his wife to wait to file and do it quietly but she refused maureen callahan ny post opinion possibly the only thing more surprising than the news that angelina jolie filed for divorce from brad pitt were the unceasing unremitting details as a brand brangelina spent more than a decade on lockdown their camp had no leaks tabloids knew nothing the couple didnt want known their image as the chicest jetsettingest most racially harmonious family on earth was impenetrable until tuesday when jolies filing demanding sole physical custody sent the media into overdrive what had pitt heretofore known as a devoted father possibly done incredibly almost on the hour the story kept advancing tmz reported that jolie had concerns with the way brad was parenting and that she was fed up with his heavy use of weed and alcohol he had an anger problem next came accusations of pitt cheating with a costar and with russian hookers their nationality an odd detail of using hard drugs and of verbally and physically attacking one of their children on a private plane within 72 hours the world knew more about brangelina than in the 12 years they had been together it was sordid and dirty the photo negative of the perfect image they had so smugly aggressively promoted the likeliest source of that narrative flip angelina jolie who at 41 has masterfully manipulated the media for over two decades strategically jolie seems miles ahead of pitt but she may lose the long game video reportedly exists of the plane incident and no physical altercation is said to have occurred people have come to admire her but they love him the whole thing seems very impetuous says jolies biographer andrew morton her mother would freeze out people for whatever reason and now angie has frozen out brad who was far more dignified and just issued a quiet statement by so publicly disparaging the father of her children some old enough to read whats being said online jolie is endangering her own selfcreated myth that of depraved hollywood hellionturnedst angelina humanitarian nonpareil its bad dad vs st ange morton says the ultimate losers are the children and jolies halo which may be revoked its easy to forget how deeply weird angelina jolie was when she came on the scene in the mid90s theres an entire generation that knows her as an actress yes but more so as the selfless philanthropist the devoted mother of six onehalf of the most glamorous couple in hollywood jolie has never used a publicist and this has only added to the sense true or not that shes authentic but she is at heart an actress jolie and her estranged father actor jon voight share one key trait both shes said are drama queens as a premillennial starlet jolie was unlike any of her peers she was in stark opposition to the arch cosmopolitan waspiness of gwyneth paltrow who was then engaged to pitt she made winona ryders eccentric darkness seem purely adolescent drew barrymore with her trauma her drug use and mid20s marriage spree could not compare jolie carved her own niche controlled her own narrative and it was impossible to look away she was the wildest of the wild she divulged thoughts and experiences so outlandish you had to wonder how much was true she spoke of selfharm rampant drug use heroin she said her favourite her bisexuality how much she loved knifeplay and sm her history of insomnia and eating disorders of committing herself to the psych ward at ucla for 72 hours of suicidal ideations and of once hiring a hit man to kill her before changing her mind all this by age 22 in 1996 she married british actor jonny lee miller she said she wed in a white shirt with millers name scrawled in blood on the back they divorced in 2000 the same year jolie began cavorting with her brother james haven on red carpets making out in front of photographers when she won the best supporting actress oscar that year for girl interrupted she gushed over him in her acceptance speech im so in love with my brother right now she said it was too weird even by hollywood standards haven quickly receded from jolies public life and within weeks she wed her pushing tin costar billy bob thornton who was then engaged to actress laura dern i left our home to work on a movie dern told talk magazine in 2000 and while i was away my boyfriend got married and ive never heard from him again jolie and thornton then 24 and 44 respectively embraced their role as hollywoods premier freakshow couple they wore vials of each others blood around their necks and boasted of wild sex on furlined harnesses the marriage lasted four years until the moment jolie said was lifechanging her decision while filming lara croft tomb raider in cambodia to adopt a child i knew once i committed to maddox she said i would never be selfdestructive again jolie divorced thornton she used the same mo as with brad accused him of having affairs and being drunk says morton her biographer as soon as maddox came along billy bob had served his purpose thus jolie began her pivot from savage manstealing sex bomb to valiant single mom of an indigent child she began working with the united nations as a goodwill ambassador her time in cambodia she said made me suddenly realise certain things about the world and how much i had to learn she was a spoiled hollywood brat who orchestrated her public awakening to the less fortunate and duly expressed shame as an actress things were less exciting she trudged along in a series of unremarkable movies original sin life or something like it beyond borders alexander it wasnt until 2004 when she replaced nicole kidman in a film called mr mrs smith that angelina jolies star power became stratospheric this of course was the movie where pitt and jolie met and fell in love at the time pitt was married to jennifer aniston and they were considered hollywoods golden couple he the wholesome midwestern matinee idol content with a bong and a beer she the alist star of friends the breezy sortofplain popular girl who had landed the highschool quarterback jolie with or without pitts knowledge helped extricate him from that marriage expertly in april 2005 amid rumours of their affair pitt flew to visit jolie and her toddler son in kenya paparazzi somehow knew to be there and a nowiconic image of jolie pitt and maddox made the cover of us weekly aniston had said goodbye to pitt hours earlier with no knowledge of his plans the world was shocked and i was shocked aniston told vanity fair that year rumours were rampant that jolie was pregnant with pitts baby compounding the tabloid narrative that pitt badly wanted to be a dad but denied by his careerobsessed wife had no choice but to leave my worst fear anistons friend kristin hahn told vanity fair is that jen will have to face them having a baby together soon because that would be beyond painful in july of that year jolie adopted a baby girl from ethiopia an event she announced in people magazine she began heavily publicising her work as a un ambassador to paraphrase the old saying about ginger rogers and fred astaire jolie gave pitt gravitas and pitt gave her respectability in may 2007 the couple relocated to namibia where a heavily pregnant jolie was again shot by paparazzi with pitt and her two children on otherwise empty sand dunes this even though the couple had gotten the namibian government to ban all journalists from entry so she could give birth there after their daughter shiloh was born pitt and jolie gave a press conference only to namibian reporters they sat on a dais with namibias president sam nujoma formerly the countrys dictator and began their spin off planet earth in 2007 jolie began forcing celebrity journalists to sign contracts before interviewing her these forbade any questions regarding her personal relationships even though her personal relationships were exactly what she was selling in april of that year people glowingly reported jolies adoption of a 3yearold boy from vietnam his mother was still living and jolie changed his name from pham quang sang to pax he spoke no english but no matter the magazine deified jolie shooting her in profile holding her new toddler as they gazed off at the horizon in less than two years jolie and pitt had a family of four i know we seem crazy just bringing them in one after the other jolie told the new york times in 2008 the year she gave birth to twins knox and vivienne but we

recognized before me was my friend don rumsfeld i dont mind that a bit it fits something of a pattern in a career that includes being chief of staff congressman and secretary of defense i havent had much that don didnt get first but truth be told any award once conferred on donald rumsfeld carries extra luster and i am very proud to see my name added to such a distinguished list to frank gaffney and all the supporters of center for security policy i thank you for this honor and i thank you for the great energy and high intelligence you bring to as vital a cause as there is the advance of freedom and the uncompromising defense of the united states most anyone who is given responsibility in matters of national security quickly comes to appreciate the commitments and structures put in place by others who came before you deploy a military force that was planned and funded by your predecessors you inherit relationships with partners and obligations to allies that were first undertaken years and even generations earlier with the authority you hold for a little while you have great freedom of action and whatever course you follow the essential thing is always to keep commitments and to leave no doubts about the credibility of your countrys word so among my other concerns about the drift of events under the present administration i consider the abandonment of missile defense in eastern europe to be a strategic blunder and a breach of good faith it is certainly not a model of diplomacy when the leaders of poland and the czech republic are informed of such a decision at the last minute in midnight phone calls it took a long time and lot of political courage in those countries to arrange for our interceptor system in poland and the radar system in the czech republic our polish and czech friends are entitled to wonder how strategic plans and promises years in the making could be dissolved just like that with apparently little if any consultation seventy years to the day after the soviets invaded poland it was an odd way to mark the occasion you hardly have to go back to 1939 to understand why these countries desire and thought they had a close and trusting relationship with the united states only last year the russian army moved into georgia under the orders of a man who regards the collapse of the soviet union as the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century anybody who has spent much time in that part of the world knows what vladimir putin is up to and those who try placating him by conceding ground and accommodating his wishes will get nothing in return but more trouble what did the obama administration get from russia for its abandonment of poland and the czech republic and for its famous reset button another deeply flawed election and continued russian opposition to sanctioning iran for its pursuit of nuclear weapons in the short of it president obamas cancellation of americas agreements with the polish and czech governments was a serious blow to the hopes and aspirations of millions of europeans for twenty years these peoples have done nothing but strive to move closer to us and to gain the opportunities and security that america offered these are faithful friends and nato allies and they deserve better the impact of making two nato allies walk the plank wont be felt only in europe our friends throughout the world are watching and wondering whether america will abandon them as well big events turn on the credibility of the united states doing what we said we would do and always defending our fundamental security interests in that category belong the ongoing missions in iraq and afghanistan and the need to counter the nuclear ambitions of the current regime in iran candidate obama declared last year that he would be willing to sit down with irans leader without preconditions as president he has committed america to an iran strategy that seems to treat engagement as an objective rather than a tactic time and time again he has outstretched his hand to the islamic republics authoritarian leaders and all the while iran has continued to provide lethal support to extremists and terrorists who are killing american soldiers in iraq and afghanistan the islamic republic continues to provide support to extremists in syria lebanon and the palestinian territories meanwhile the regime continues to spin centrifuges and test missiles and these are just the activities we know about i have long been skeptical of engagement with the current regime in tehran but even iran experts who previously advocated for engagement have changed their tune since the rigged elections this past june and the brutal suppression of irans democratic protestors the administration clearly missed an opportunity to stand with irans democrats whose popular protests represent the greatest challenge to the islamic republic since its founding in 1979 instead the president has been largely silent about the violent crackdown on irans protestors and has moved blindly forward to engage irans authoritarian regime unless the islamic republic fears real consequences from the united states and the international community it is hard to see how diplomacy will work next door in iraq it is vitally important that president obama in his rush to withdraw troops not undermine the progress weve made in recent years prime minister maliki met yesterday with president obama who began his press availability with an extended comment about afghanistan when he finally got around to talking about iraq he told the media that he reiterated to maliki his intention to remove all us troops from iraq former president bushs bold decision to change strategy in iraq and surge us forces there set the stage for success in that country iraq has the potential to be a strong democratic ally in the war on terrorism and an example of economic and democratic reform in the heart of the middle east the obama administration has an obligation to protect this young democracy and build on the strategic success we have achieved in iraq we should all be concerned as well with the direction of policy on afghanistan for quite a while the cause of our military in that country went pretty much unquestioned even on the left the effort was routinely praised by way of contrast to iraq which many wrote off as a failure until the surge proved them wrong now suddenly and despite our success in iraq were hearing a drumbeat of defeatism over afghanistan these criticisms carry the same air of hopelessness they offer the same shortsighted arguments for walking away and they should be summarily rejected for the same reasons of national security having announced his afghanistan strategy last march president obama now seems afraid to make a decision and unable to provide his commander on the ground with the troops he needs to complete his mission president obama has said he understands the stakes for america when he announced his new strategy he couched the need to succeed in the starkest possible terms saying quote if the afghan government falls to the taliban or allows alqaeda to go unchallenged that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can end quote five months later in august of this year speaking at the vfw the president made a promise to americas armed forces i will give you a clear mission he said defined goals and the equipment and support you need to get the job done thats my commitment to you its time for president obama to make good on his promise the white house must stop dithering while americas armed forces are in danger make no mistake signals of indecision out of washington hurt our allies and embolden our adversaries waffling while our troops on the ground face an emboldened enemy endangers them and hurts our cause recently president obamas advisors have decided that its easier to blame the bush administration than support our troops this weekend they leveled a charge that cannot go unanswered the presidents chief of staff claimed that the bush administration hadnt asked any tough questions about afghanistan and he complained that the obama administration had to start from scratch to put together a strategy in the fall of 2008 fully aware of the need to meet new challenges being posed by the taliban we dug into every aspect of afghanistan policy assembling a team that traveled to pakistan and afghanistan reviewing options and recommendations and briefing presidentelect obamas team they asked us not to announce our findings publicly and we agreed giving them the benefit of our work and the benefit of the doubt the new strategy they embraced in march with a focus on counterinsurgency and an increase in the numbers of troops bears a striking resemblance to the strategy we passed to them they made a decision a good one i think and sent a commander into the field to implement it now they seem to be pulling back and blaming others for their failure to implement the strategy they embraced its time for president obama to do what it takes to win a war he has repeatedly and rightly called a war of necessity its worth recalling that we were engaged in afghanistan in the 1980s supporting the mujahadeen against the soviets that was a successful policy but then we pretty much put afghanistan out of our minds while no one was watching what followed was a civil war the takeover by the taliban and the rise of bin laden and alqaeda all of that set in motion the events of 911 when we deployed forces eight years ago this month it was to make sure afghanistan would never again be a training ground for the killing of americans saving untold thousands of lives is still the business at hand in this fight and the success of our mission in afghanistan is not only essential it is entirely achievable with enough troops and enough political courage then theres the matter of how to handle the terrorists we capture in this ongoing war some of them know things that if shared can save a good many innocent lives when we faced that problem in the days and years after 911 we made some basic decisions we understood that organized terrorism is not just a lawenforcement issue but a strategic threat to the united states at every turn we understood as well that the safety of the country required collecting information known only to the worst of the terrorists we had a lot of blind spots and thats an awful thing especially in wartime with many thousands of lives potentially in the balance we didnt think it made sense to let the terrorists answer questions in their own good time if they answered them at all the intelligence professionals who got the answers we needed from terrorists had limited time limited options and careful legal guidance they got the baddest actors we picked up to reveal things they really didnt want to share in the case of khalid sheik muhammed by the time it was over he was not was not only talking he was practically conducting a seminar complete with chalkboards and charts it turned out he had a professorial side and our guys didnt mind at all if classes ran long at some point the mastermind of 911 became an expansive briefer on the operations and plans of alqaeda it happened in the course of enhanced interrogations all the evidence and common sense as well tells us why he started to talk the debate over intelligence gathering in the seven years after 911 involves much more than historical accuracy what were really debating are the means and resolve to protect this country over the next few years and long after that terrorists and their state sponsors must be held accountable and america must remain on the offensive against them we got it right after 911 and our government needs to keep getting it right year after year president after president until the danger is finally overcome our administration always faced its share of criticism and from some quarters it was always intense that was especially so in the later years of our term when the dangers were as serious as ever but the sense of general alarm after 911 was a fading memory part of our responsibility as we saw it was not to forget the terrible harm that had been done to america and not to let 911 become the prelude to something much bigger and far worse eight years into the effort one thing we know is that the enemy has spent most of this time on the defensive and every attempt to strike inside the united states has failed so you would think that our successors would be going to the intelligence community saying how did you did you do it what were the keys to preventing another attack over that period of time instead theyve chosen a different path entirely giving in to the angry left slandering people who did a hard job well and demagoguing an issue more serious than any other theyll face in these four years no one knows just where that path will lead but i can promise you this there will always be plenty of us willing to stand up for the policies and the people that have kept this country safe on the political left it will still be asserted that tough interrogations did no good because this is an article of faith for them and actual evidence is unwelcome and disregarded president obama himself has ruled these methods out and when he last addressed the subject he filled the air with vague and useless platitudes his preferred device is to suggest that we could have gotten the same information by other means were invited to think so but this ignores the hard inconvenient truth that we did try other means and techniques to elicit information from khalid sheikh muhammed and other alqaeda operatives only turning to enhanced techniques when we failed to produce the actionable intelligence we knew they were withholding in fact our intelligence professionals in urgent circumstances with the highest of stakes obtained specific information prevented specific attacks and saved american lives in short to call enhanced interrogation a program of torture is not only to disregard the programs legal underpinnings and safeguards such accusations are a libel against dedicated professionals who acted honorably and well in our countrys name and in our countrys cause whats more to completely rule out enhanced interrogation in the future in favor of halfmeasures is unwise in the extreme in the fight against terrorism there is no middle ground and halfmeasures keep you half exposed for all that weve lost in this conflict the united states has never lost its moral bearings and least of all can that be said of our armed forces and intelligence personnel they have done right they have made our country safer and a lot of americans are alive today because of them last january 20th our successors in office were given the highest honors that the voters of this country can give any two citizens along with that george w bush and i handed the new president and vice president both a record of success in the war on terror and the policies to continue that record and ultimately prevail we had been the decision makers but those seven years four months and nine days without another 911 or worse were a combined achievement a credit to all who serve in the defense of america including some of the finest people ive ever met what the present administration does with those policies is their call to make and will become a measure of their own record but i will tell you straight that i am not encouraged when intelligence officers who acted in the service of this country find themselves hounded with a zeal that should be reserved for americas enemies and it certainly is not a good sign when the justice department is set on a political mission to discredit disbar or otherwise persecute the very people who helped protect our nation in the years after 911 there are policy differences and then there are affronts that have to be answered every time without equivocation and this is one of them we cannot protect this country by putting politics over security and turning the guns on our own guys we cannot hope to win a war by talking down our country and those who do its hardest work the men and women of our military and intelligence services they are after all the true keepers of the flame thank you very much

freedom has been predicated on truth the founders were visionary in this regard understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of america story continued below as the distinguished former member of this body daniel patrick moynihan of new york famously said everyone is entitled to his own opinion but not to his own facts during the past year i am alarmed to say that senator moynihans proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history it is for that reason that i rise today to talk about the truth and its relationship to democracy for without truth and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts mr president our democracy will not last 2017 was a year which saw the truth objective empirical evidencebased truth more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government it was a year which saw the white house enshrine alternative facts into the american lexicon as justification for what used to be known simply as good oldfashioned falsehoods it was the year in which an unrelenting daily

spoken by josef stalin to describe his enemies it bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase enemy of the people that even nikita khrushchev forbade its use telling the soviet communist party that the phrase had been introduced by stalin for the purpose of annihilating such individuals who disagreed with the supreme leader this alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body especially for those of us in the presidents party for they are shameful repulsive statements and of course the president has it precisely backward despotism is the enemy of the people the free press is the despots enemy which makes the free press the guardian of democracy when a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesnt suit him fake news it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion not the press i dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of fake news are dubious at best those of us who travel overseas especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe encounter members of us based media who risk their lives and sometimes lose their lives reporting on the truth to dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice according to the international federation of journalists 80 journalists were killed in 2017 and a new report from the committee to protect journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262 which is a new record this total includes 21 reporters who are being held on false news charges mr president so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the presidents time in office here in america we do not pay obeisance to the powerful in fact we question the powerful most ardently to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship and so we know well that no matter how powerful no president will ever have dominion over objective reality no politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not and anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account that is our job here and that is just as madison hamilton and jay would have it of course a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong politicians dont no longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence no longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions and mr president an american president who cannot take criticism who must constantly deflect and distort and distract who must find someone else to blame is charting a very dangerous path and a congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger now we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the most corrupt and dishonest media awards it beggars belief that an american president would engage in such a spectacle but here we are and so 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it in this effort the choice is quite simple and in this effort the truth needs as many allies as possible together my colleagues we are powerful together we have it within us to turn back these attacks right these wrongs repair this damage restore reverence for our institutions and prevent further moral vandalism together united in the purpose to do our jobs under the constitution without regard to party or party loyalty let us resolve to be allies of the truth and not partners in its destruction it is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year but a brief survey is in order some untruths are trivial such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last years inaugural but many untruths are not at all trivial such as the seminal untruth of the presidents political career the oftrepeated conspiracy about the birthplace of president obama also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud which are as destructive as they are inaccurate to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts federal law enforcement the intelligence community and the free press to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all the supposed hoax at the heart of special counsel robert muellers russia investigation to be very clear to call the russia matter a hoax as the president has many times is a falsehood we know that the attacks orchestrated by the russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both american sovereignty and to our national security it is in the interest of every american to get to the bottom of this matter wherever the investigation leads ignoring or denying the truth about hostile russian intentions toward the united states leaves us vulnerable to further attacks we are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinetlevel meeting regarding russian interference and how to defend america against these attacks not one what might seem like a casual and routine untruth so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of washington is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country mr president let us be clear the impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign they have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them the destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated mr president every word that a president utters projects american values around the world the values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free between the mighty and the modest truth is the great leveler and so respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports but a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm reading from the story in februarysyrian president bashar assad brushed off an amnesty international report that some 13000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying you can forge anything these days we are living in a fake news era in the philippines president rodrigo duterte has complained of being demonized by fake news last month the report continues with our president quote laughing by his side duterte called reporters spies in july venezuelan president nicolas maduro complained to the russian propaganda outlet that the world media had spread lots of false versions lots of lies about his country adding this is what we call fake news today isnt it there are more a state official in myanmar recently said there is no such thing as rohingya it is fake news referring to the persecuted ethnic group leaders in singapore a country known for restricting free speech have promised fake news legislation in the new year and on and on this feedback loop is disgraceful mr president not only has the past year seen an american president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language this is reprehensible we are not in a fake news era as bashar assad says we are rather in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself to challenge free people and free societies everywhere in our own country from the trivial to the truly dangerous it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm and spur to action add to that the bynow predictable habit of calling true things false and false things true and we have a recipe for disaster as george orwell warned the further a society drifts from the truth the more it will hate those who speak it any of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair but in our positions to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions simply put it is the presss obligation to uncover the truth about power it is the peoples right to criticize their government and it is our job to take it what is the goal of laying siege to the truth president john f kennedy in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the voice of america was eloquent in answer to that question we are not afraid to entrust the american people with unpleasant facts foreign ideas alien philosophies and competitive values for a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people mr president the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine but for those who cherish american constitutional democracy what matters is the effect on america and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world made all the more unstable by these very fabrications what matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions we are a mature democracy it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring or worse endorsing these attacks on the truth for if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics we are lost i sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today i will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that i find has special resonance at this moment his name was john jacques and as a young missionary in england he contemplated the question what is truth his search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that i grew up with titled oh say what is truth it ends as follows then say what is truth tis the last and the first for the limits of time it steps oer tho the heavens depart and the earths fountains burst truth the sum of existence will weather the worst eternal unchanged evermore thank you mr president i yield the floor this article tagged under donald trump jeff flake

politifact12773,1,americans need to stand together hillary clintons remarks following the orlando shooting hillary clinton delivered an address pledging that as president she would take on lone wolves who might carry out terrorist attacks in the united states and calling for unity in light of the massacre at a gay nightclub in orlando on sunday the compete transcript of her remarks in cleveland are posted below speaker former secretary of state hillary rodham clinton democratic presidential candidate clinton thank you applause thank you all very much applause thank you thank you all applause thank you thank you i am im absolutely im absolutely delighted to be back in cleveland and to be here at the industrial innovation center ive had a chance to learn about the great work you do here i especially want to applaud team wendy for everything you do to protect our troops first responders advertisement applause and others from traumatic brain injury it is so important that we continue to support those who protect us audience we want hillary clinton thank you audience we want hillary clinton thank you all audience we want hillary applause clinton it is good to be back in cleveland i can tell you that applause i want to thank i wan to thank your extraordinary senator sherrod brown for his leadership for that very kind and generous introduction you are very fortunate to to have him representing you i want to thank your congresswoman marcia fudge applause who is both indomitable and indefatigable she is such a tenacious advocate for the people she represents i want to acknowledge the mayor mayor jackson who was here county executive budish ph and i particularly want to recognize the passing of george voinovich and he devoted his life to serving the people of ohio as mayor of cleveland as governor and senator and we send our prayers and sympathy to his family advertisement i also want to thank dan moore the owner and founder of this company and team wendy for his belief in cleveland for his commitment to create jobs i cant wait to work with him to do more of what he has accomplished here applause you know originally i had intended to come to cleveland under very different circumstances we are heading into a general election that could be the most consequential of our lifetimes but today is not a day for politics on sunday americans woke up to a nightmare thats become mind numbingly familiar another act of terrorism in a place no one expected a madman filled with hate with guns in his hands and just a horrible sense of vengeance and vindictiveness in his heart apparently consumed by rage against lgbt americans and by extension the openness and diversity that defines our american way of life advertisement we will learn more about the killer in the days to come we know that he pledged allegiance to isis that they are now taking credit and that part of their strategy is to radicalize individuals and encourage attacks against the united states even if they are not coordinated with isis leadership but theres a lot we still dont know including what other mix of motives drove him to kill the more we learn about what happened the better well be able to protect our people going forward in the days ahead we will also learn more about the many lives he viciously cut short many of them young people just starting out in their lives they were travel agents and pharmacy techs college students and amusement park workers sons and daughters brothers and sisters and they had one thing in common they all had a lot more to give clinton we should take a moment today amid our busy lives to think about them to pray for everyone who was killed for the wounded those who are fighting to regain their lives and futures for our first responders who walked into danger one more time as a mother i cant imagine what those families are going through advertisement but lets also remember the other scenes we saw on sunday we saw the faces of some of those first responders who rushed into danger and tried to save as many people as they could we saw survivors like chris hansen who risked their lives to help others people gathering outside hospitals to comfort anxious family members waiting for news of their loved ones and waiting too to learn more about what they could do to make sure this never happened again religion leaders condemning hate and appealing for peace people lining up to donate blood americans refusing to be intimidated or divided yesterday i called mayor dyer of orlando and offered my support and my appreciation for the leadership that he and the other officials have shown this is a moment when all americans need to stand together advertisement no matter how many times we endure attacks like this the horror never fades the murder of innocent people breaks our hearts tears at our sense of security and makes us furious now we have to steal our resolve to respond and thats what i want to talk to you about how we respond the orlando terrorist may be dead but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive and we must attack it with clear eyes steady hands unwavering determination and pride in our country and our values applause i have no doubt i have no doubt we can meet this challenge if we meet it together whatever we learn about this killer his motives in the days ahead we know already the barbarity that we face from radical jihadists is profound in the middle east isis is attempting a genocide of religious and ethnic minorities they are slaughtering muslims who refuse to accept their medieval ways they are beheading civilians including executing lgbt people they are murdering americans and europeans enslaving torturing and raping women and girls advertisement in speeches like this one after paris brussels and san bernardino i have laid out a plan to defeat isis and the other radical jihadist groups in the region and beyond the attack in orlando makes it even more clear we cannot contain this threat we must defeat it and the good news is that the coalition effort in syria and iraq has made recent gains in the last months so we should keep the pressure on ramping up the air campaign accelerating support for our friends fighting to take and hold ground and pushing our partners in the region to do even more we also need continued american leadership to help resolve the political conflicts that fuel isis recruitment efforts but as isis loses actual ground in iraq and syria it will seek to stage more attacks and gain stronger footholds wherever it can from afghanistan to libya to europe advertisement the threat is metastasizing we saw this in paris and we saw it in brussels we face a twisted ideology and poisoned psychology that inspires the socalled lone wolves radicalized individuals who may or may not have contact and direction from any formal organization clinton so yes efforts to defeat isis on the battlefield must succeed but it will take more than that applause we have to be just as adaptable and versatile as our enemies as president i will make identifying and stopping lone wolves a top priority applause i will put a team together from across our government the entire government as well as the private sector and communities to get on top of this urgent challenge and i will make sure our law enforcement and intelligence professionals have all the resources they need to get the job done advertisement as we do this there are three areas that demand attention first we and our allies must work handinhand to dismantle the networks that move money and propaganda and arms and fighters around the world applause we have to flow we have to stem the flow of jihadists from europe and iraq syria afghanistan and then back again the only way to do this is by working closely with our partners strengthening our alliances not weakening them or walking away from them second here at home we must harden our own defenses we have to do more to support our first responders law enforcement and intelligence officers who do incredible work every day at great personal risk to keep our country safe applause i have seen firsthand how hard their job is and how well they do it in orlando at least one police officer was shot in the head thankfully his life was saved by a kevlar helmet something folks here at team wendy know a lot about applause it has often been said that our law enforcement our intelligence agencies our first responders have to be right 100 percent of the time but terrorists only have to be right once what a heavy responsibility these men and women deserve both our respect and gratitude and they deserve the right tools and resources and training too often state and local officials cant get access to intelligence from the federal government that would help them do their jobs we need to change that we also need to work applause we also need to work with local law enforcement and business owners on ways to protect vulnerable socalled soft targets like nightclubs and shopping malls and hotels and movie theaters and schools and houses of worship now i know a lot of americans are asking how it was possible that someone already on the fbis radar could have still been able to commit an attack like the one in orlando and what more we can do to stop this kind of thing from happening again well we have to see what the investigation uncovers if there are things that can and should be done to improve our ability to prevent we must do them we already know we need more resources for this fight the professionals who keep us safe would be the first to say we need better intelligence to discover and disrupt terrorist plots before they can be carried out thats why i have proposed an intelligence surge to bolster our capabilities across the board with appropriate safeguards here at home even as we make sure our security officials get the tools they need to prevent attacks its essential that we stop terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out the attack applause clinton and that is especially true when it comes to assault weapons like those used in orlando and san bernardino applause i believe weapons of war have no place on our streets and we may have our disagreements about gun safety regulations but we should all be able to agree on a few essential things if the fbi is watching you for a suspected terrorist link you shouldnt be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked and you shouldnt be able to exploit loopholes and evade criminal background checks by buying online or at a gun show and yes if youre too dangerous to get on a plane you are too dangerous to buy a gun in america now i know some will say that assault weapons and background checks are totally separate issues having nothing to do with terrorism well in orlando and san bernardino terrorists used assault weapons the ar15 and they used it to kill americans that was the same assault weapon used to kill those little children in sandy hook we have to make it harder for people who should not have those weapons of war and that may not stop every shooting or every terrorist attack but it will stop some and it will save lives and it will protect our first responders and i want you to know im not going to stop fighting for these kinds of provisions now the third area that demands attention is preventing radicalization and countering efforts by isis and other international terrorist networks to recruit in the united states and europe for starters it is long past time for the saudis the qataris and the kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations and they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism we also have to use all our capabilities to counter jihadist propaganda online this is something that i spend a lot of time on at the state department as president i will work with our great tech companies from silicon valley to boston to step up our game we have to a better job intercepting isis communications tracking and analyzing social media posts and mapping jihadist networks as well as promoting credible voices who can provide alternatives to radicalization and there is more to do offline as well clinton since 911 law enforcement agencies have worked hard to build relationships with muslim american communities millions of peaceloving muslims live work and raise their families across america and they are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before its too late and the best positioned to help us block it so we should be intensifying contacts in those communities not scapegoating or isolating them applause last year i visited a pilot program in minneapolis that helps parents teachers imams mental health professionals and others recognize signs of radicalization in young people and work with law enforcement to intervene before its too late ive also met with local leaders pursuing innovative approaches in los angeles and other places and we need more efforts like that in more cities across america and as the director of the fbi has pointed out we should avoid eroding trust in that community which will only make law enforcements job more difficult inflammatory antimuslim rhetoric and threatening to ban the families and friends of muslim americans as well as millions of muslim business people and tourists from entering our country hurts the vast majority of muslims who love freedom and hate terror applause so does saying that we have to start special surveillance on our fellow americans because of their religion its no coincidence that hate crimes against american muslims and mosques have tripled after paris and san bernardino thats wrong and its also dangerous it plays right into the terrorists hands still as i have said before none of us can close our eyes to the fact that we do face enemies who use their distorted version of islam to justify slaughtering innocent people theyd take us all back to the stone age if they could just as they have in parts of iraq and syria the terrorist in orlando targeted lgbt americans out of hatred and bigotry and an attack on any american is an attack on all americans applause and i want to say this to all the lgbt people grieving today in florida and across our country you have millions of allies who will always have your back applause and i am one of them applause from stonewall to laramie and now orlando weve seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely openly and without fear has been met by violence we have to stand together be proud together there is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate our open diverse society is an asset in the struggle against terrorism not a liability it makes us stronger and more resistant to radicalization and this raises a larger point about the future of our country america is strongest when we all believe that we have a stake in our country and our future clinton this vision has sustained us from the beginning the belief that yes we are all created equal and the journey we have made to turn that into reality over the course of our history that we are not a land of winners and losers that we should all have the opportunity to live up to our godgiven potential and we have a responsibility to help others do so as well applause as i look at american history i see that this has always been a country of we not me we stand together because we are stronger together e pluribus unum one out of many one has seen us through the darkest chapters of our history ever since 13 squabbling colonies put aside their disagreements and united because they realized they were going to rise together or fall separately generation after generation has fought and marched and organized to widen the circle of dignity and opportunity ending slavery securing and expanding the right to vote throwing open the doors of education building the greatest middle class the world has ever seen and we are stronger when more people can participate in our democracy applause and we are stronger when everyone can share in the rewards of our economy and contribute to our communities when we bridge our divides and lift each other up instead of tearing each other down now we have overcome a lot together and we will overcome the threats of terror and radicalization and all of our other challenges here in ohio and across america ive listened to people talk about the problems that keep you up at night the bonds that hold us together as communities as one national community are strained by an economy with too much inequality and too little upward mobility by social and political divisions that have diminished our trust in each other and our confidence in our shared future i have heard that and i want you to know as your president i will work every day to break down all the barriers holding you back and keeping us apart were gonna get an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top were gonna forge a new sense of connection and shared responsibility to each other and our nation and finally applause finally let me remind us all i remember i remember how it felt on the day after 911 and i bet many of you do as well americans from all walks of life rallied together with a sense of common purpose on september the 12th and in the days and weeks and months that followed we had each others backs i was a senator from new york there was a republican president a republican governor and a republican mayor we did not attack each other we worked with each other to protect our country and to rebuild our city ph applause president bush went to a muslim community center just six days after the attacks to send a message of unity and solidarity to anyone who wanted to take out their anger on our muslim neighbors and fellow citizens he said that should not and that will not stand in america it is time to get back to the spirit of those days spirit of 912 lets make sure we keep looking to the best of our country to the best within each of us democratic and republican presidents have risen to the occasion in the face of tragedy that is what we are called to do my friends and i am so confident and optimistic that is exactly what we will do

depression for many years her family tells the hollywood reporter messick who worked at miramax as a production executive from 1997 to 2003 also served as rose mcgowans manager in january 1997 which is when mcgowan has claimed she was raped by harvey weinstein in a statement following her death her family says messick was victimized after becoming embroiled in the weinsteinmcgowan allegations her name made headlines when weinsteins attorney ben brafman released an email on jan 30 attributed to messick in defense of his client her family says now that messick became collateral damage in an already horrific story messicks familys full feb 8 statement is below the movement just lost one of its own jill messick was a mother of two children a loving wife and partner a dear friend to many and a smart entertainment executive she was also a survivor privately battling depression which had been her nemesis for years today she did not survive jill took her own life jill was victimized by our new culture of unlimited information sharing and a willingness to accept statement as fact the speed of disseminating information has carried mistruths about jill as a person which she was unable and unwilling to challenge she became collateral damage in an already horrific story jill believed in the movement she supported every woman finally coming forward to share their dark truths and expose those who had committed previously unspeakable deeds she was loyal she was strong jill was many things but she was not a liar over the past few months many women have come out with allegations against harvey weinstein including rose mcgowan who has repeatedly spoken with the press striking out against not only her alleged attacker but a great many others one of them was jill who chose to remain silent in the face of roses slanderous statements against her for fear of undermining the many individuals who came forward in truth she opted not to add to the feeding frenzy allowing her name and her reputation to be sullied despite having done nothing wrong she never chose to be a public figure that choice was taken away from her now that jill can no longer speak for herself its time to set the record straight in january 1997 jill was an entrylevel manager at addis wechsler one of her first clients was rose mcgowan and one of jills first duties was to set up a breakfast meeting with harvey weinstein during the sundance film festival following the meeting rose told jill what had happened that she made the decision to remove her clothes and get in the hot tub with him a mistake which rose immediately regretted rose never once used the word rape in that conversation despite this jill recognized that harvey had done something untoward to rose if not illegal she immediately went to her bosses the partners of addis wechsler to recount roses story and to insist that they immediately address the situation they told jill that they would handle the situation the ensuing arrangements between rose and harvey were then negotiated completely without jills knowledge at that time all jill knew was that the matter was settled and that rose continued making films with the weinsteins she never knew any details until recently when rose elected to make them public ten months later in november of 1997 jill received a call from the miramax exec vp of production recruiting her for a job as an executive at miramax films working in production in los angeles jill was hired based on merit and her excellent work of over two years as a young development executive working with woods entertainment prior to her time at addis wechsler roses most recent round of press to promote her book has included new stories involving jill the constant press attention rose has garnered in print and on national tv led to harvey weinstein releasing two documents one of these was an email that jill wrote to him months prior to the first new york times piece coming out and at his request in this email jill offered the truth based on what she remembers rose telling her about the sundance account in the face of roses continued and embellished accusations last week harvey took it upon himself to release the email without her consent five years ago jill suffered a manic episode anyone familiar with bipolar disorder knows that it is a cruel and vicious disease with the help of doctors her family and friends jill rebounded jill had fought to put her life back together after a long job search she was in negotiations to run the production division for a new entertainment company seeing her name in headlines again and again as part of one persons attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause along with harveys desperate attempt to vindicate himself was devastating for her it broke jill who was just starting to get her life back on track what makes roses inaccurate accusations and insinuations against jill ironic was that she was the first person who stood up on roses behalf and alerted her bosses to the horrific experience which rose suffered twenty years ago as a very junior person in a management company hierarchy jill exhibited her integrity in doing the right thing she raised the red flag with the heads of her firm in the face of inappropriate behavior jill handled the situation appropriately hers is one of the only stories that has stayed consistent over time as we watch other media reported tales morph to beget further attention while journalists serve an important role in exposing predatory behavior we are seeing irresponsible choices and an addiction to sensationalism which leads to inconsistent storytelling the media is a powerful tool not to be taken lightly most individuals would be horrified to have their name spotlighted in a major international news story let alone their photograph we cannot forget that the media is a fearsome tool which cannot be used indiscriminately or even inadvertently to create further victims there is a responsibility when using a platform to accurately expose criminals predators mistruths and misdeeds while protecting the actual truth of third parties as we collectively seek to take action in an effort to right the wrongs so brazenly and inhumanely repeated for a generation we must not forget one simple truth words have power while we illuminate the dark corners for hidden truths we must remember that what we say particularly in the media can have just as much impact if not more than our actions we must ask more of ourselves and of each other we must take a moment to consider the ramifications and consequences of what we say and what we do words matter someones life may depend on it

colleague callie interrupts with a question about tonights sitter but arizona tells her the dinner still feels weird callie has two babysitter options as the sitter they usually have cant come arizona tells her not to get the new sitter and callie leaves arizona then compares jackson with the new babysitter and that she trusts the other babysitter which would be mark more jackson doesnt want to insulted again and interrupts her speech about marks investment in jamess case to tell her that hell be doing it marks way she thanks him and apologizes for having insulted him bailey tells sheila that a rib punctured her husbands lung when she landed on him they need to operate but hell be okay callie brings by a pillow to make sheilas ride to radiology more comfortable about the scan sheila wants to know if its okay if she has metal on her cookie they dont understand so sheila lifts the blanket she bedazzled her vagina which is called vajazzling callie enthusiastically recognizes a butterfly but she stops when bailey gives her a look derek and shane are still playing ping pong shepherd won again but he suspects shane is letting him win shane is he doesnt want to offend by derek by winning because derek is a competitive guy derek says all neurosurgeons are and he thought shane has all what it takes to be one shane realizes that derek is goating him shane still is a little hesitant as he thinks derek will never want to see him again if shane wins which wouldnt be helpful on shanes quest to become him derek thinks this is creepy and he convinces shane to put up a real game by promising to put in a good word for him by dr ramsey so shane can assist her tomorrow shane then plays the ball scoring a point richard is talking with a nurse as he suddenly sees catherine standing in front of him she in town to operate but for now she made lunch reservations for them as she had to see him richard walks away but catherine stops him by saying that shes worried because jackson told her hes not operating shes worried hes not eating and sleeping enough he yells shes not his wife his wife died while he was carrying on with her he purposefully didnt answer her calls meredith comes over and hears what hes saying he doesnt want her there and asks him to be excused as he and meredith have a surgery catherine is visibly hurt by his words jo and alex are watching the pingpong tournament when she asks him what her sleeping arrangements will now be instead of the floor alex says hes waiting for cristina to save and furnish the place jo gives him a look but he defends himself saying the plan is genius alex cheers on derek and rhetorts to jo that her friend is choking jo suggests they make the game more interesting and offers they bet 100 on each player though neither of them have the money they agree callie walks over asking whos winning and the two doctors banter as to which one is doing better shepherd scores past shane and callie giggles saying that thats her wrist in there shane then scores past shepherd and jo smugly requests 500 to alexs dismay callie goes inside insisting they take a break so she can examine dereks wrist both refuse and continue playing aggresively callie reminds them that this is not wimbleton but a hospital conference table being used to strengthen muscles so you can operate both are enamored in the game and ignoring what she is saying on her way out she reminds derek to respond to her email about the dinner and to come even if he doesnt want to because if he comes everybody else will too jo asks alex what dinner callie is referring to and he informs her about the judgment and consolation money jo congratulates cristina on her reward and asks if shell be using any of it to furnish the house cristina says she doesnt need to since its not her house jo gives alex a look reiterating his previous comment on his plan being genius cristina walks into the conference room and asks shane for the paddle she begins playing shepherd and tells him he needs to forgive owen because hes holding a grudge youre making it sound like he stole my lunch out of the refrigerator derek says cooly cristina says that they won the case and they need to move on and let owen move on too derek reminds her that owen put them on the plane cristina reminds him that he too once was chief and he had a lot of difficult decisions to make at a time and he needs to forgive owen derek angrily scores past cristina telling her its not that easy she says she knows but to forgive him anyway as she drops the paddle and leaves the room shane and derek resume their game cristina tells jo to get back to work as she leaves jo reminds alex about the 500 and to let her know how it goes james and his girlfriend are sitting in the preop room as jackson walks in the girlfriend gives him a kiss and tells him hell do great and shell see him after volleyball practice the next day when she leaves james makes a comment to jackson saying he knows his girlfriends hot and hes wondering how he got a girl like that jackson disagrees at first but then admits hes curious james tells him that sloanes calling him weird wasnt him being mean but reminding him that surgery was only going to get him so far he was never going to look completely normal so he had to develop some moves to attract the women jackson laughs saying sloane gave him a couple tips saying getting women was sloanes specialty james says that sloane told him his moves would never work for him and that he had to come up with his own james says he blinds them with his amazing personality and that they dont even notice the face jackson comments that its working and james said he does okay but not being weirdlooking would be good too he tells jackson theres no pressure and jackson tells him hell see what he can do about it the doctors come in to wheel him to the or bailey is operating on sheilas husband and commenting that she doesnt understand what happened to good old fashioned sex without all the embellishments like vajazzling bailey asks april if men bedazzle their penises and she says she really doesnt want to think about it bailey tells somebody to look it up and leah quickly goes on her phone bailey continues saying its foolish and idiotic she stares at april and asks her if shes ever vajazzled herself april looks up uncomfortably and glares at her bailey remembers that jesus isnt a fan of the vajazzle she asks bokhee if she did and she walks away neither confirming nor denying meredith asks webber if it feels good to be back in the or as they operate on taylor webber tells her to focus on the patient when cutting into the stomach they pull out a giant hair ball due to her eating her own hair heather comments that she used to eat dirt meredith and webber look at her in shock and she assures them that she hasnt in years webber and meredith share a look a crowd has gathered to watch shane and derek play pingpong alex walks over and jo tells him he made it right in time to lose since its the final point alex is sure that shepherd will win jo extends her hand offering double or nothing and the two shake on it after calling him scared jo and alex get even more competitive urging on their teammates after a heated round shane scores past shepherd resulting in a loud cheer from jo shepherd asks for another game but shane says he won fair and square shane begins to act like hes talking to a friend demanding shepherd to let him scrub in on an operation he quickly catches himself and apologizes thanking him for the game but he wants to go operate shepherd starts another game with his dominant hand jo is celebrating in the hallway and following alex to the cash machine doing a victory dance meredith walks in to the hall of horrors with the hairball in a jar she places it on a shelf saying its too cool to allow it to go to medical waste she asks webber how hes going to get rid of all the stuff he says that while she sees scissors and other stuff he sees a thanksgiving he didnt take off to be with adele in london the teratoma kept him from their anniversary he says that even though hes proud of saving it it only reminds him of his failure webber changes the topic by saying meredith must be happy with the money and asks her what shes planning on doing with the money she says its blood money lexie is dead webber assures her its a good thing and asks if she hasnt suffered enough she asks him the same sheila is waiting in the hallway for confirmation about her xrays callie tells her its just a bruised tailbone and that she can go home now april says that her husband will be in the hospital only for a couple of days bailey tells her no driving or sexual activity for at least a month sheila is saddened by this as bailey hands her the bedazzled gems bailey snaps telling her to stay off the pole sheila tells her that she just got back from her honeymoon but to talk to her after 45 years of marriage and raising three kids you get tired and you want to give up but she doesnt want to do that at least shes trying callie apologizes for bailey saying she didnt mean to judge sheila starts to cry saying that the worst part is that he looked embarrassed for her and that that hurts more than a bruised tailbone she survived 45 years of marriage and is it so bad that she wants to celebrate her anniversary with a little sex the doctors assure her that it is not jackson is informing the interns that he will instruct them how to prep for this surgery arizona runs in upset that he reverted back to his idea instead of marks original jackson assures her that he spoke to the parents and the plastics attending but arizona tells him that mark had an idea for a reason jackson says he knows that but mark is no longer here and he needs to do what he thinks is best jackson prepares james for surgery while arizona looks in disagreement callie tells bailey that maybe sheilas husband couldnt get an erection anymore which is why he looked embarrassed bailey disagrees saying maybe he was just embarrassed for her callie tells her that theyre sweet and that of all people bailey should understand an older couple with a healthy sex life bailey says she does appreciate them but she only had sex once on her honeymoon ben wanted to have sex on the beach and not in the hotel suite bailey says she got sand in her cookie afterwards they went to the doctor only to find out she had a vaginal infection and there were sand flea bites on her butak and that it would become very itchy and he was right bailey says that her honeymoon consisted of an infection and itching so she is not a big fan of the beach or the pole or anywhere callie starts laughing hysterically and bailey storms away as callie continues to laugh at a restaurant callie asks the quiet group how everybodys dinner is everybody comments that its good and continues eating derek asks arizona how james surgery went and

politifact6939,1,obama mitt romney refused to say whether he supports lilly ledbetter act updated thursday october 25th 2012 at 208 pm asked about fair pay for women during the second presidential debate president barack obama was quick to bring up the first piece of legislation he signed into law the lilly ledbetter fair pay act audience member katherine fenton asked obama in what new ways to you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn obama talked about being raised by a single mom who put herself through school and of his grandmother who worked her way up from a bank secretary to a vice president but hit the glass ceiling she trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career she didnt complain thats not what you did in that generation he said at the debate at hofstra university on oct 16 2012 and this is one of the reasons why one of the first the first bill i signed was something called the lilly ledbetter bill romney responded by saying at one point he had more women in senior leadership positions than any other governor and that he wanted to help more women find jobs obama jumped in saying katherine i just want to point out that when gov romneys campaign was asked about the lilly ledbetter bill whether he supported it he said ill get back to you and thats not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy did romney and his campaign really refuse to say whether he supported the law sort of the law which obama signed on jan 29 2009 made it easier for workers to pursue wage discrimination claims but received little republican support in congress it updated 1960s civil rights and age discrimination laws to reset the statute of limitations on such claims with each new paycheck in 2007 the supreme court had ruled in ledbetter vs goodyear tire rubber co that the 180day statute of limitations started from the day an employer made the decision to discriminate making it harder for employees who claimed such discrimination later to get relief such as back pay what did romney have to say about it for a previous factcheck in may the obama campaign directed us to a couple media reports in an april 2012 conference call covered by a washington post blogger a huffington post reporter asked an unnamed romney adviser whether romney supported the lilly ledbetter act the adviser responded sam stein well get back to you on that later romney spokeswoman andrea saul clarified in an email he supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law the second piece the obama campaign showed us was a romney interview by diane sawyer of abc news sawyer asked romney if you were president you had been president would you have signed the lilly ledbetter law romneys response romney its certainly a piece of legislation i have no intention of changing i wasnt there three years ago sawyer but would you have signed it romney im not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say had i been there which ones would i have supported and signed but i certainly support equal pay for women and and have no intention of changing that law dont think theres a reason to sign up for politifact texts here romney did refuse to say whether he would have signed the bill into law but he also said he has no intention of changing that law our ruling obama said that when asked whether he would have signed the lilly ledbetter act into law romneys campaign said ill get back to you his point was that the campaign was dodging the question indeed a romney adviser did say earlier this year that he would get back to a reporter about whether he supported the lilly ledbetter act a spokeswoman then said he would not change it and romney later said he certainly supports equal pay for women and has no intention of changing that law so obama is correct about the initial statement but romney later clarified by saying he wouldnt change the law we rate obamas claim mostly true correction a previous version of this item said the supreme courts ledbetter decision made it impossible for employees who learned of such discrimination later to get relief such as back pay in fact the court declined to address the question of whether employees who learned of discrimination after the statute of limitations expired would be protected under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964

politifact4887,1,before leaving governors office in 2006 mitt romneys staff eliminated email records officials from the two prior administrations of governors paul cellucci and jane swift could not be reached last night leaving it unclear whether their aides took similar actions regarding hard drives emails and computer servers they have an obligation as a public official to preserve their records galvin said electronic records are held to the same standard as paper records theres no question theyre not in some lesser standard galvin pointed out that in 1997 the supreme judicial court ruled that the governor is not explicitly included in the public records law he said that means that emails dont have to be released to the public but the governors office still has to preserve them and turn them over to the state archivist i dont sell things to people who work for me said galvin a democrat ive heard of people getting their chair or something as a gift but generally if you work for me you dont take your laptop with you when you leave secretary of state william f galvin who oversees the state public records law said it appeared odd that state property in this case hard drives was essentially being sold to private individuals she accused patrick of doing the obama campaigns dirty work and called it one in a series of political attacks to distract from obamas horrible record on jobs patrick a democrat is a close friend and supporter of president obama and is expected to play a prominent role in his reelection campaign in leaving office the governors staff complied with the law and longtime executive branch practice she said some employees exercised the option to purchase computer equipment when they left they did so openly with personal checks andrea saul a spokeswoman for the romney campaign said the governors aides did nothing wrong the governors office has found no emails from 20022006 in our possession reilly said in a statement before the current administration took office the computers used during that time period were replaced and the server used during that time period was taken out of service all files were removed from it and it was also replaced as a result patricks office which has been bombarded with inquiries for records from the romney era has no electronic record of any romney administration emails reilly said romney administration officials had the remaining computers in the governors office replaced just before governor deval patricks staff showed up to take power in january 2007 according to mark reilly patricks chief legal counsel just before mitt romney left the massachusetts governors office and first ran for president 11 of his top aides purchased their stateissued computer hard drives and the romney administrations emails were all wiped from a server according to interviews and records obtained by the globe just before leaving office romneys staff went before the records conservation board which is made up of appointees from various state agencies and reviews public record retention in some cases the romney administration was given permission to destroy records galvin said oftentimes because they were redundant i know that all of the romney materials were dealt with by the public records board galvin said that doesnt mean that what was portrayed to the records board was a complete and accurate summary i dont know that mark nielsen who was romneys chief legal counsel bought his hard drive on dec 12 2006 just over two weeks before patrick administration officials took over the governors office the longstanding practice in the governors office was to give employees the option to buy old equipment when they were leaving office and certain employees including me did that nielsen told the globe but those purchases were in conformance with the law and with longstanding executive branch practice im confident that we complied with the letter and the spirit of the law he added when asked why he would want to purchase his hard drive he said employees were given that option and it was my understanding that it was a longstanding practice in the governors office when asked about replacing the remaining computers and wiping the server clean he said all i can tell you is we fully complied with the law and complied with longstanding executive branch practice nothing unusual was done pam wilmot executive director of common cause massachusetts said romney administration officials may not have violated the letter of the state public records law but may have run afoul of its spirit information that was generated in the administration belongs to the people of the commonwealth unless it was personal in nature she said there is a place for purchasing of surplus property but there are procedures to do that and it seems that we are as a commonwealth losing something if all records were deleted all told 11 romney administration officials bought 17 hard drives from the governors office paying 65 for each one according to copies of canceled checks that they wrote and members of the current administration many of the aides wrote equipment or hard drives in the memo space on their checks beth e myers who was romneys chief of staff bought her hard drive on aug 18 2006 the same month that she left state employment she later became romneys campaign manager peter g flaherty who was romneys deputy chief of staff bought the hard drive from his computer on nov 3 2006 four days before patrick was elected defeating his republican opponent kerry healey who was romneys lieutenant governor flaherty later became the romney campaigns chief liaison to social conservatives the rest of the hard drives were bought in november and december of 2006 by other aides while patrick aides said they do not have any electronic records of romney administration emails galvin said there are 700 to 800 boxes of paper records from the romney era at the state archives in boston in 2009 mayor thomas m menino of boston was embroiled in controversy after one of his top aides michael j kineavy acknowledged that he had deleted nearly every email he sent or received over the previous five years the law requires municipal employees to preserve emails for at least two years even if they have no informational or evidential value and provides for penalties of up to a year in jail a ninemonth investigation by attorney general martha coakleys office concluded however that the destruction of the emails was not a crime because kineavy was not willfully attempting to hide the

advertisement and former secretary of state hillary clinton applause very good to be here with you clinton thank you ifill welcome to you both woodruff now a word about format there will be two short breaks and the rules are simple 90 seconds for each answer and 30 seconds for the other candidate to respond ifill with iowa and new hampshire behind us we are now broadening the conversation to americas heartland and beyond including here in wisconsin now lets turn to the candidates for their opening statements the order was decided by coin toss and senator sanders you go first sanders well gwen and judy thank you very much for hosting this event and pbs thank you nine months ago our campaign began and when it began we had no political organization no money and not much name recognition outside of the state of vermont a lot has happened in nine months advertisement and what has happened is i think the american people have responded to a series of basic truths and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt which is undermining american democracy which allows wall street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice sanders and aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy and thats an economy where ordinary americans are working longer hours for low wagers they are worried to death about the future of their kids and yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent and then in addition to that the american people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system they see more people in jail in the united states of america than any other country on earth 22 million were spending 80 billion a year locking up fellow americans advertisement they see kids getting arrested for marijuana getting in prison getting a criminal record while they see executives on wall street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all no criminal records for them i think what our campaign is indicating is that the american people are tired of establishment politics tired of establishment economics they want a political revolution in which millions of americans stand up come together not let the trumps of the world divide us and say you know what in this great country we need a government that represents all of us not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors thank you ifill thank you senator sanders applause ifill thank you senator sanders secretary clinton clinton im running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding americans back and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every american a chance to advance especially those who have been left out and left behind advertisement i know a lot of americans are angry about the economy and for good cause americans havent had a raise in 15 years there arent enough goodpaying jobs especially for young people and yes the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top we both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that wall street never wrecks main street again but i want to go further i want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many americans right now africanamericans who face discrimination in the job market education housing and the criminal justice system hardworking immigrant families living in fear who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future guaranteeing that womens work finally gets the pay the equal pay that we deserve advertisement i think america can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every american has a chance to live up to his or her potential that will be my mission as president and i think together we will make progress woodruff thank you both applause woodruff thank you both and well be right back after a short break to begin questions woodruff and welcome back to this pbs newshour debate democratic debate here in milwaukee lets get right to the questions senator sanders to you first coming off the results in iowa and new hampshire there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you and your ideas and theyre asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government its already spending 21 of the entire us economy how much larger would government be in the lives of americans under a sanders presidency advertisement sanders well to put that in a context judy i think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top onetenth of 1 whose percentage of wealth has doubled in other words the very rich are getting richer almost everybody is going getting poorer what i believe is the united states in fact should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people our medicare for all singlepayer proposal will save the average middle class family 5000 a year i do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free i believe that when real unemployment is close to 10 and when our infrastructure our roads our bridges our water systems flint michigan comes to mind our waste water plants our rail our airports in many places are disintegrating advertisement yeah we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars woodruff but my question is how big would government be would there be any limit on the size of the role of government sanders of course there will be a limit but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality when the middle class is disappearing you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on earth yes in my view the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living clinton judy i think that the best analysis that ive seen based on senator sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40 but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans lets take healthcare for example last week in a cnn town hall the senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about 500 dollars in taxes to get about 5000 dollars in healthcare every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers dont add up and thats a promise that cannot be kept and its really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because especially with healthcare this is not about math this is about peoples lives and we should level with the american people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare sanders well let us level with the american people secretary clinton has been going around the country saying bernie sanders wants to dismantle the affordable care act people are going to lose their medicaid theyre going to lose their chip program i have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people were not going to dismantle everything but here is the truth twentynine million people have no health insurance today in america we pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs one out of five americans cant even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing millions of people have high deductibles and copayments what i said and let me repeat it i dont know what economists secretary clinton is talking to but what i have said and let me repeat it that yes the middle the family right in the middle of the economy would pay 500 dollars more in taxes and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of 5000 dollars in my view healthcare is a right of all people not a privilege and i will fight for that clinton i can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage you know before it was called obamacare it was called hillarycare and i took on the drug companies and i took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage applause and why i am a staunch supporter of president obamas principal accomplishment namely the affordable care act is because i know how hard it was to get that done we are at 90 percent coverage we have to get the remaining 10 ive set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down especially prescription drug costs and it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share but i think the american people deserve to know specifically how this would work if its medicare for all then you no longer have the affordable care act because the affordable care act as you know very well is based on the insurance system based on exchanges based on a subsidy system the childrens health insurance program which i helped to create which covers 8 million kids is also a different kind of program so if youre having medicare for all singlepayer you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing and based on every analysis that i can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal the numbers dont add up and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now ifill final thought senator sanders that is absolutely inaccurate look here is the reality folks there is one major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people there is one major country the united states which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the uk guaranteeing health care to all people 50 percent more than they do in france guaranteeing health care to all people far more than our canadian neighbors who guarantee health care to all people please do not tell me that in this country if and heres the if we have the courage to take on the drug companies and have the courage to take on the insurance companies and the medical equipment suppliers if we do that yes we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way clinton well let me just let me just say once again applause that having been in the trenches fighting for this i believe strongly we have to guarantee health care i believe we are on the path to doing that the last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again and we are not england we are not france we inherited a system that was set up during world war ii 170 million americans get health insurance right now through their employers so what we have tried to do and what president obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have get us to 90 percent coverage we have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100 i far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again gridlocking our system and trying to get from zero to 100 percent applause ifill id like to move along id like to move along secretary clinton you might you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government you may remember this pledge from a state of the union address at which i believe you were present in which these words were said the era of big government is over you may remember that when asked your feelings about the federal government this week 61 percent of new hampshire democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied given what you and senator sanders are proposing an expanding government in almost every area of our lives is it fair for americans who fear government to fear you clinton no but it is absolutely fair and necessary for americans to vet both of our proposals to ask the really hard questions about what is it we think we can accomplish why do we believe that and what would be the results for the average american family in my case whether its health care or getting us to debtfree tuition or moving us toward paid family leave i have been very specific about where i would raise the money how much it would cost and how i would move this agenda forward ive tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted because i feel like we have to level with people for the very reason gwen that you are mentioning there is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government im aware of that it comes from the right from the left from people on all sides of the political spectrum clinton so we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for which is why i think we should not make promises we cant keep because that will further i think alienate americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in peoples lives ifill but i havent heard either of you put a price tag on your you say crosstalk clinton i will put a price tag my price tag is about 100 billion a year and again paid for and what i have said is i will not throw us further into debt i believe i can get the money that i need by taxing the wealthy by closing loopholes the things that we are way overdue for doing and i think once im in the white house we will have enough political capital to be able to do that but i am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear especially with young people about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost ifill senator sanders well secretary clinton youre not in the white house yet and let us be clear that every proposal that i have introduced has been paid for for example all right who in america denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling roads bridges water systems wastewater plants who denies that who denies that real unemployment today including those who have given up looking for work and are working parttime is close to 10 percent who denies that africanamerican youth unemployment real is over 50 percent we need to create jobs so yes i will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the cayman islands and bermuda and in a given year pay zero zero in federal income tax yes im going to do away with that we will use those proceeds a hundred billion a year to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure yes i believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on wall street that they are a wall street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the great recession great depression yes i do believe that now after the american people bailed wall street out yes they should pay a wall street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuitionfree we bailed them out now it is their time to help the middle class applause clinton you know i think again both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young americans and i have set forth a compact that would do just that for debtfree tuition we differ however on a couple of key points one of them being that if you dont have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students its hard to get to where we need to go and senator sanderss plan really rests on making sure that governors like scott walker contribute 23 billion on the first day to make college free i am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that applause woodruff next were going to sanders a brief response woodruff very brief thank you sanders here is where we are with public education a 100 150 years ago incredibly brave americans said you know what working class kids low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms like rich kids they deserve to get a free education and that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade the world has changed this is 2016 in many ways a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 60 years ago so yes i do believe that when we talk about public education in america today in a rapidly changing world we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities that should be a right of all americans regardless of the income of their families applause woodruff secretary clinton your campaign you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters you have talked repeatedly about the fact we know you would be if elected the first woman president but in new hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for senator sanders what are women missing about you clinton well first judy i have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices even if that choice is not to vote for me i believe that its most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society and i feel very strongly that i have an agenda i have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face so im going to keep making that case im going to keep making sure that everything ive done everything that i stand for is going to be well known but i have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support i just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me thats what im working towards applause woodruff as you know just quickly as you know your strong supporter former secretary of state madeleine albright said the other day that theres a special place in hell for women who dont support other women do you agree with what she said clinton well look i think that shes been saying that for as long as ive known her which is about 25 years but it doesnt change my view that we need to empower everyone women and men to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make thats what ive always stood for and when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether were going to have equal pay paid family leave some opportunity for you know women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them i think that we still have some barriers to knock down which is why thats at the core of my campaign i would note just for a historic aside somebody told me earlier today weve had like 200 presidential primary debates and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage so you know well take our progress wherever we can find it applause woodruff senator sanders youre in the minority but we still want to hear from you laughter sanders look we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women from men straight gay africanamericans latinos asianamericans we are trying to bring america together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class i am very proud if my memory is not correct i think i am that i have a lifetime and ive been in congress a few years a lifetime 100 percent prochoice voting record i am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of vermont from very significant majorities of women im very proud that i support legislation that is currently in the congress got support of almost all progressive democrats in the house and senate which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men and we will join the rest of the other the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families applause ifill senator do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history as senator clinton keeps claiming that she might be the first woman president sanders well you know i think from a historical point of view somebody with my background somebody with my views somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests i think a sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment as well applause clinton you know i have said i have said many times you know im not asking people to support me because im a woman im asking people to support me because i think im the most qualified experienced and ready person to be the president and the commander inchief applause and i appreciate greatly senator sanders voting record and i was very proud to get the endorsement of the planned parenthood action fund because ive been a leader on these issues i have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep womens health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves clinton im very proud that naral endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on womens issues somebody who yes votes right but much more than that leads the efforts to protect the hardfought gains that women have made that make no mistake about it are under tremendous attack not just by the republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back womens rights so im asking women im asking men to support me because im ready to go into the white house on january 20th 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges applause woodruff final comment sanders let me concur with the secretary no question womens rights are under fierce attack all over this country and i will tell you something that really galls me i will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy just a little bit all over this country we have republican candidates for president saying we hate the government government is the enemy were going to cut social security to help you were going to cut medicare and medicaid federal aid to education to help you because the government is so terrible but by the way when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice ah in that case my republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in america if thats not hypocrisy i dont know what hypocrisy is applause ifill thank you both ifill we turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at facebook they were selected from a curated group of people weve been following of undecided voters the first comes from claudia looze a 54yearold woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in madison wisconsin and she writes wisconsin is number one in africanamerican male incarceration according to a university of wisconsin study they found that wisconsins incarceration rate for black men which is at 13 percent was nearly double the countrys rate what can we do across the nation to address this senator sanders sanders this is one of the great tragedies in our country today and we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug it has to be dealt with today a male africanamerican baby born today stands a oneinfour chance of ending up in jail that is beyond unspeakable so what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system applause sanders what we have to do is end overpolicing in african american neighborhoods the reality is that both the africanamerican community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates the reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations the truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites we need fundamental police reform clearly clearly when we talk about a criminal justice system i would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people often africanamericans shot by police officers what we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will in fact be held accountable applause clinton you know i completely agree with senator sanders the first speech i gave in this campaign back in april was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration the statistics from wisconsin are particularly troubling because it is the highest rate of incarceration for africanamericans in our nation twice the national average and we know of the tragic terrible event that lead to the death of dontre hamilton right here in milwaukee a young man unarmed who should still be with us his family certainly believes that and so do i so we have work to do there have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen president obamas policing commission came out with some i have fully endorsed those clinton but we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect and then we have to go after sentencing and thats one of the problems here in wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesnt happen at the federal level it happens at the state and local level but i would also add this there are other racial discrepancies really systemic racism in this state as in others education in employment in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people particularly young men are pushed out of school early are denied employment opportunities so when we talk about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration we also have to talk about jobs education housing and other ways of helping communities applause sanders nothing that secretary clinton said do i disagree with this mandatory sentencing a very bad idea it takes away discretion from judges we have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies applause we have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity and where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see people are being released from jail without the education without the job training without the resources that they need to get their lives together then they end up were shocked that they end up back in jail again so we have a lot of work to do but here is a pledge ive made throughout this campaign and its really not a very radical pledge when we have more people in jail disproportionately african american and latino than china does a communist authoritarian society four times our size heres my promise at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country we will invest in education and jobs for our kids not incarceration and more jails applause woodruff secretary clinton i was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for president obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership and his example hardly anyone believes that they have why do you think race relations would be better under a clinton presidency what would you do that the nations first african american has not been able to clinton well im just not sure i agree completely with that assessment i think under president obama we have seen a lot of advances the affordable care act has helped more african americans than any other group to get insurance to be taken care of but we also know a lot more than we did we have a lot more social media we have everybody with a cellphone so we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society i think president obama has set a great example i think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult but he has gone forward now what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next we now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system we now have some good models about how better to provide employment housing and education i think what president obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first african american president and to address it both from the presidents office and through his advocacy such as working with young men and mrs obamas work with young women but we cant rest we have work to do and we now know a lot more than we ever did before so its going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open nobody can deny them to use the justice department as we just saw they have said they are going to sue ferguson that entered into a consent agreement and then tried to back out so were going to enforce the law were going to change policing practices were going to change incarceration practices but were also going to emphasize education jobs and housing applause woodruff senator sanders applause sanders well i think judy what has to be appreciated is that as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on wall street millions of lives were hurt people lost their jobs their homes their life savings turns out that the africanamerican community and the latino community were hit especially hard as i understand it the africanamerican community lost half of their wealth as a result of the wall street collapse so when you have childhood africanamerican poverty rates of 35 percent when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration which by the way leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother clearly we are looking at institutional racism we are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and sadly in america today in our economy a whole lot of those poor people are africanamerican woodruff so race relation was be better under a sanders presidency than theyve been sanders absolutely because what we will do is say instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires we are going to create millions of jobs for lowincome kids so theyre not hanging out on street corners were going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education and i think when you give lowincome kids africanamerican white latino kids the opportunities to get their lives together they are not going to end up in jail theyre going to end up in the productive economy which is where we want them applause ifill let me turn this on its head because when we talk about race in this country we always talk about africanamericans people of color i want to talk about white people ok sanders white people ifill i know laughter so many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country by the middle of this century the nation is going to be majority nonwhite our public schools are already there if working class white americans are about to be outnumbered are already underemployed in many cases and one study found they are dying sooner dont they have a reason to be resentful senator secretary clinton clinton look i am deeply concerned about whats happening in every community in america and that includes white communities where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism addiction earlier deaths people with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived this is a remarkable and horrifying fact and thats why ive come forward with for example a plan to revitalize coal country the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy by the reduction in the use of coal you know coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering has our country forgotten us do people not care about all of our sacrifice and im going to do everything i can to address distressed communities whether they are communities of color whether they are white communities whether they are in any part of our country i particularly appreciate the proposal that congressman jim clyburn has the 102030 proposal to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty and you know what if you look at the numbers there are actually as many if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out so yes i do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white americans particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have you know no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities because we have to focus where the real hurt is and thats why as president i will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that applause ifill senator senator i want you to respond to that but i also want you to am i wrong is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race sanders yeah you can because africanamericans and latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages and high unemployment and poor educational opportunities but they face other problems as well so yes we can talk about it as a racial issue but it is a general economic issue sanders and heres what the economic issue is the wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less whether you are white or black than they used to be why is that because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate america through nafta and permanent normal trade relations with china secretary clinton and i disagree on those issues but view is those trade policies have enabled corporate america to shut down in this country throw millions of people out on the street now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world but you know what you can make a middle class wage you have decent health care decent benefits you once had a pension those jobs in many cases are now gone theyre off to china now you are a worker white worker black worker who had a decent job that manufacturing job is gone what have you got now you are working at mcdonalds that is why there is massive despair all over this country people have worked their entire lives theyre making a half twothirds what they used to make their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all and thats why this study which shows that if you can believe it today for white working class people between 45 and 54 life expectancy is actually going down suicide alcoholism drugs thats why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power applause woodruff thank you senator sanders one of the causes of anxiety for working class americans is connected to immigrants president obama as you know has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the united states to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits would you go further than that and if so how specifically would you do it should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight say in nevada rest easy not fear of further deportations under a sanders presidency sanders the answer is yes weve got 11 million undocumented people in this country i have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported i believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform something that i strongly supported i believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship i agree with president obama who used executive orders to protect families because the congress the house was unable or refused to act and in fact i would go further what would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform judy is to bring families together not divide them up and let me say this also somebody who is very fond of the president agrees with him most of the time i disagree with his recent deportation policies and i would not support those bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people if congress doesnt do the right thing we use the executive orders of the president applause clinton i strongly support the presidents executive actions i hope the supreme court upholds them i think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did i am against the raids im against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families waking them up in the middle of the night rounding them up we should be deporting criminals not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country im a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform have been ever since i was in the senate i was one of the original sponsors of the dream act i voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007 senator sanders voted against it at that time because i think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship and as president i would expand enormous energy literally call every member of congress that i thought i could persuade hopefully after the 2016 election some of the republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country and they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform applause sanders secretary clinton i do have a disagreement here if my memory is correct i think when we saw children coming from these horrendous horrendously violent areas of honduras and neighboring countries people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence i thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country that was not as i understand it the secretarys position in terms of 2007 immigration reform yeah i did vote against it i voted against it because the southern poverty law center among other groups said that the guestworker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery akin to slavery where people came into this country to do guest work were abused were exploited and if they stood up for their rights theyd be thrown out of this country so it wasnt just me who opposed it it was lulac one of the large latino organizations in this country it was the aflcio it was some of the most progressive members of the united states congress who opposed it for that reason but we are where we are right now and where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up what we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people clinton two quick responses one with respect to the central american children i made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately but we also had to send a message to families and communities in central america not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers ive also called for the end of family detention for the end of privatelyrun detention centers along with private prisons which i think are really against the common good and the rule of law and with respect to the 2007 bill this was ted kennedys bill and i think ted kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done and i was proud to stand with him and support it applause woodruff id like sanders well let me just respond i worked with ted kennedy he was the chairman of my committee and i loved ted kennedy but on this issue when you have one of the large latino organizations in america saying vote no and you have the aflcio saying vote no and you have leading progressive democrats in fact voting no i dont apologize for that vote but in terms of the children i dont know to whom youre sending a message who are you sending a message to these are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake that was the fact i dont think we use them to send a message i think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together applause clinton well that just wasnt that just wasnt the fact senator the fact is that there was a great effort made by the obama administration and others to really send a clear message because we knew that so many of these children were being abused being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border so we have a disagreement on this i think now what ive called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made applause ifill if you would allow me now to move on weve been talking about children i want to talk about seniors that takes us to our second facebook question from farheen hakeem who writes my father shes a 40yearold woman who works for a nonprofit here in milwaukee and she writes my father gets just 16 in food assistance per month as part of medicaids family community program in milwaukee county for lowincome seniors how will you as president work to ensure lowincome seniors get their basic needs met start with you senator sanders sanders ok you know you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has but by how you treat we treat the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation and by those standards were not doing particularly well sanders we have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on earth and in terms of seniors there are millions of seniors and ive talked to them in my state of vermont and all over this country who are trying to get by on 11000 12000 13000 a year social security and you know what you do the arithmetic you cant get by on 11000 12000 13000 a year and heres an area where secretary clinton and i believe we have a difference i have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the social security trust fund starting at 250000 applause and when we and when we do that we dont do what the republicans want which is to cut social security we do what the american people want to expand social security by 1300 a year for people under 16000 and we extend the life of social security for 58 years yes the wealthiest people the top 15 percent will pay more in taxes but a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half where they dont have decent nutrition where they cant heat their homes in the wintertime that is not what america should be about if elected president i will do everything i can to expand social security benefits not just for seniors but for disabled veterans as well applause clinton i think i think its fair to say we dont have a disagreement we both believe there has to be more money going into the social security system ive said im looking at a couple of different ways one which you mentioned senator but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the social security trust fund i have a slightly different approach though about what we should do with that initially first rather than expand benefits for everyone i do want to take care of lowincome seniors who worked at lowwage jobs i want to take care of women when the social security program was started in the 1930s not very many women worked and women have been disadvantaged ever since they do not get any credit for their caretaking responsibilities and the people who are often the most hardhit are widows because when their spouse dies they can lose up to onehalf of their social security monthly payment so we have no disagreement about the need to buttress social security get more revenue into the program but i want to start by helping those people who are most at risk the ones who yes are cutting their pills in half who dont believe they can make the rent who are worried about what comes next for them sanders in all due respect applause sanders in all due respect secretary clinton a lot of the progressive groups the online groups have really asked you a simple question are you coming onboard a proposal and what is that proposal now the proposal that i have outlined you know should be familiar to you because it is what essentially barack obama campaigned on in 2008 you opposed him then i would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do were asking the top 15 percent including passive income to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity i hope you will make a decision soon on this clinton well senator look i think were in vigorous agreement here we both want to get more revenue in i have yet to see a proposal that youre describing that the raising the cap would apply to passive income that has not been sanders thats my bill check it out clinton well that has not been a part of most of the proposals that ive seen im interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it so im going to come up with the best way forward were going to end up in the same place were going to get more revenue im going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first applause woodruff were going to move on secretary clinton your campaign has recently ramped up criticism of senator sanders for attending democratic party fundraisers from which you say he benefited but nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers george soros and donald sussman for a total of about 10 million woodruff you have said that theres no quid pro quo involved is that also true of the donations that wealthy republicans give to republican candidates contributors including the koch brothers clinton i cant speak for the koch brothers youre referring to a super pac that we dont coordinate with that was set up to support president obama that has now decided that they want to support me they are the ones who should respond to any questions lets talk about our campaigns im very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions so im proud of senator sanders and his supporters i think its great that senator sanders president obama and i have more donors than any three people who have every run certainly on the democratic side thats the way it should be and im going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me to encourage them and help me do more just as senator sanders is i think that is the real key here we both have a lot of small donors i think that sets us apart from a lot of whats happening right now on the republican side the koch brothers have a very clear political agenda it is an agenda in my view that would do great harm to our country were going to fight it as hard as we can and were going to fight whoever the republicans nominate who will depend on the koch brothers and others applause woodruff im asking if democratic donors are different than republican donors sanders what we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system thats what were talking about we have to be honest about it it is undermining american democracy when extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to super pacs and in many cases in this campaign super pacs have raised more money than individual candidates have ok we had a decision to make early on do we do a super pac and we said no we dont represent wall street we dont represent the billionaire class so it ends up im the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no super pac but what we did is we said to the working families of this country look we know things are tough but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics and establishment economics send us something and it turns out that up until and this has blown me away never in a million years would i have believed that i would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people now secretary clintons super pac as i understand it received 25 million dollars last reporting period 15 million dollars from wall street our average contribution is 27 dollars im very proud of that applause ifill senator sanders are you saying clinton we are mixing apples and oranges my 750000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations im very proud that i think between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country but the real issue i think that the senator is injecting into this is that if you had a super pac like president obama has which now says it wants to support me its not my pac if you take donations from wall street you cant be independent i would just say i debated then senator obama numerous times on stages like this and he was the recipient of the largest number of wall street donations of anybody running on the democratic side ever now when it mattered he stood up and took on wall street he pushed through and he passed the doddfrank regulation the toughest regulations since the 1930s so lets not in anyway imply here that either president obama or myself would in anyway not take on any vested interested whether its wall street or drug companies or insurance companies or frankly the gun lobby to stand up to do whats best for the american people applause sanders the people arent dumb why in gods name does wall street applause but lets not but lets not lets not insult lets not insult the intelligence of the american people people arent dumb why in gods name does wall street make huge campaign contributions i guess just for the fun of it they want to throw money around laughter why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs why does the fossil fuel industry pay spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions any connection to the fact that not one republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system applause and when we talk about wall street lets talk about wall street i voted for doddfrank got an important amendment in it in my view it doesnt go anywhere near far enough but when we talk about wall street you have wall street and major banks have paid 200 billion in fines since the great crash no wall street executive has been prosecuted applause clinton well lets just lets just follow up on this because you know ive made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail no executive too powerful to jail and because of doddfrank we now have in law a process that the president the federal reserve and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk i think thats a major accomplishment i agree however it doesnt go far enough because what it focuses on are the big banks which senator sanders has talked about a lot for good reason i go further in the plan that ive proposed which has been called the toughest most effective comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face it was an investment bank lehman brothers that contributed to our collapse it was a big insurance company aig it was countrywide mortgage my plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be and i believe that not only barney frank paul krugman and others have said that what i have proposed is the most effective it goes in the right direction we have doddfrank we can use it to break up the banks if thats appropriate but lets not kid ourselves as we speak there are new problems on the horizon i want to get ahead of those and thats why ive proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these crosstalk applause woodruff we have to go to a break we sanders let me you know again respectfully disagree with secretary clinton here when you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the gdp of america while issuing twothirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages look i think if teddy roosevelt were alive today that great trustbuster would have said break them up i think he would have been right i think he would have said bring back a 21stcentury glasssteagall legislation i think that would have been right as well thats my view applause woodruff all right thank you both it is time for a break and when we come back were going to turn to some new topics including how these candidates will keep america safe ifill theres a lot more to come in just a few minutes stay with us for more of the pbs newshour democratic debate break woodruff welcome back to the democratic presidential debate before we return to our questions we have a followup question from our facebook group and it is to senator sanders senator it comes from bill corfield he is a 55yearold musician from troy ohio and he asks are there any areas of government you would like to reduce sanders hey im in the united states senate and anyone who doesnt think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very very mistaken i believe in government but i believe in efficient government not wasteful government ifill how about you senator clinton secretary clinton clinton absolutely and you know there are a number of programs that i think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve there are a lot of training programs and education programs that i think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful in public schools community colleges and colleges and universities i would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that were taking a hard look about what we have you know and what we dont need anymore and thats what i intend to do sanders if i could just answer that we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the department of defense which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited and i have the feeling youre going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities applause ifill we spent the first part of this debate talking about domestic insecurity the second part we want to talk about our foreign policy insecurities and we want to start with a question for you secretary clinton about americas role in the world americans are becoming increasingly worried that attacks abroad are coming home that they already are in fact here according to exit polls from last week from earlier this week more than two thirds of democrats in new hampshire are concerned about sending their children to fight in wars they cant win they fret that the next attack is just around the corner and we are not ready are we clinton look i think we are readier than we used to be but its a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be we have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 911 and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks yet we see the terrible attack in san bernardino and know that we havent done enough so we have to go after this both abroad and at home we have to go after terrorist networks predominantly isis thats not the only one but lets focus on that for a minute we have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from isis that is principally an americanled air campaign that we are now engaged in we have to support the fighters on the ground principally the arabs and the kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from raqqa to ramadi we have to continue to work with the iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside iraq like mosul when they are able to do so and we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters and we have to take on isis online they are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda a celebrator of violence an instigator of attacks using their online presence here at home weve got to do a better job coordinating between federal state and local law enforcement we need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources but from sources overseas that can be a realtime fusion effort to get information where its needed but the final thing i want to say about this is the following you know after 911 one of the efforts that we did in new york was if you see something or hear something suspicious report it and we need to do that throughout the country but we need to understand that american muslims are on the front line of our defense they are more likely to know whats happening in their families and their communities and they need to feel not just invited but welcomed within the american society so when somebody like donald trump and others applause stirs up the demagoguery against american muslims that hurts us at home its not only offensive its dangerous and the same goes for overseas where we have to put together a coalition of muslim nations i know how to do that i put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program applause and you dont go tell muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the united states who insults their religion so this has to be looked at overall and we have to go at it from every possible angle ifill senator sanders sanders let me just say this what a president of the united states has got to do and what is his or her major i think responsibility is to a make certain that we keep our people safe that we work with allies around the world to protect president of the united states has got to do and what is his or her major i think responsibility is to a make certain that we keep our people safe that we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity i voted against the war in iraq because i listened very carefully to what president bush and vice president cheney had to say and i didnt believe them and if you go to my web site berniesanderscom what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war but much of what i feared would happen when i spoke on the floor of the house in fact did happen in terms of the instability that occurred now i think an area in kind of a vague way or not so vague where secretary clinton and i disagree is the area of regime change look the truth is that a powerful nation like the united states certainly working with our allies we can overthrow dictators all over the world and god only knows saddam hussein was a brutal dictator we could overthrow assad tomorrow if we wanted to we got rid of gadhafi but the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator its to understand what happens the day after and in libya for example the united states secretary clinton as secretary of state working with some other countries did get rid of a terrible dictator named gadhafi but what happened is a political vacuum developed isis came in and now occupies significant territory in libya and is now prepared unless we stop them to have a terrorist foothold but this is nothing new this has gone on 50 or 60 years where the united states has been involved in overthrowing governments mossadegh back in 1953 nobody knows who mossadegh was democraticallyelected prime minister of iran he was overthrown by british and american interests because he threatened oil interests of the british and as a result of that the shah of iran came in terrible dictator the result of that you had the iranian revolution coming in and that is where we are today unintended consequences so i believe as president i will look very carefully about unintended consequences i will do everything i can to make certain that the united states and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the middle east applause clinton if i could just respond two points one senator sanders voted in 1998 on what i think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to iraq calling for the end of saddam husseins regime he voted in favor of regime change with libya voted in favor of the security council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do which of course we followed through on i do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat isis in 2016 its very important we focus on the threats we face today and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in when people go to vote in primaries or caucuses they are voting not only for the president they are voting for the commanderin chief and its important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are and who is best prepared for dealing with them as we all remember senator obama when he ran against me was against the war in iraq and yet when he won he turned to me trusting my judgment my experience to become secretary of state i was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years applause sanders judy if i can there is no question secretary clinton and i are friends and i have a lot of respect for her that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs secretary of state for four years youve got a bit of experience i would imagine but judgment matters as well judgment matters as well and she and i looked at the same evidence coming from the bush administration regarding iraq i lead the opposition against it she voted for it but more importantly in terms of this libya resolution that you have noted before this was a virtually unanimous consent everybody voted for it wanting to see libya move toward democracy of course we all wanted to do that sanders that is very different than talking about specific action for regime change which i did not support clinton you did support a un security council approach which we did follow up on and look i think its important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the obama administration was and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin laden i looked at the evidence i looked at the intelligence i got the briefings i recommended that the president go forward it was a hard choice not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that and at the end of the day it was the presidents decision so he had to leave the situation room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision im proud that i gave him that advice and im very grateful to the brave navy seals who carried out that mission applause sanders judy one area very briefly woodruff just a final word sanders where the secretary and i have a very profound difference in the last debate and i believe in her book very good book by the way in her book and in this last debate she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of henry kissinger now i find it rather amazing because i happen to believe that henry kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country applause i am proud to say that henry kissinger is not my friend i will not take advice from henry kissinger and in fact kissingers actions in cambodia when the united states bombed that country overthrew prince sihanouk created the instability for pol pot and the khmer rouge to come in who then butchered some 3 million innocent people one of the worst genocides in the history of the world so count me in as somebody who will not be listening to henry kissinger applause ifill secretary clinton clinton well i know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy and we have yet to know who that is sanders well it aint henry kissinger thats for sure clinton thats fine thats fine laughter you know i listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas i think it is fair to say whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are that with respect to china one of the most challenging relationships we have his opening up china and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of china is an incredibly useful relationship for the united states of america applause so if we want to pick and choose and i certainly do people i listen to people i dont listen to people i listen to for certain areas then i think we have to be fair and look at the entire world because its a big complicated world out there sanders it is clinton and yes people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the united states applause sanders i find i mean its just a very different you know historical perspective here kissinger was one of those people during the vietnam era who talked about the domino theory not everybody remembers that you do i do the domino theory you know if vietnam goes china da da da da da da da thats what he talked about the great threat of china and then after the war this is the guy who in fact yes youre right he opened up relations with china and now pushed various type of trade agreements resulting in american workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to china the terrible authoritarian communist dictatorship he warned us about now hes urging companies to shut down and move to china not my kind of guy applause woodruff senator let me let me move on to another country with which the us has a complicated relationship senator sanders and thats russia on the one hand were aware that russia is a country that the united states needs to cooperate with woodruff just tonight secretary of state john kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the russians to lead that could lead toward a ceasefire in syria would be the first cessation of conflict in that country in that civil war in five years but it comes at a very high price because not only have all have we seen the deaths the removal of so many people millions of people we now see the russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits president assad has not gone after isis so my question to you is when it comes to dealing with russia are you prepared how hard are you prepared to be are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions would you be prepared to move militarily if russia moves on eastern europe it seems to me that russia recently has gotten the better of the united states sanders well this is what i would say it is a complicated relationship i congratulate secretary of state john kerry and the president for working on this agreement as youve indicated what is happening in syria the number of people the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed men women 20000 children the people who are forced to flee their own country their own country it is unspeakable it is a real horror now what i think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with russia but lets be clear russias aggressive actions in the crimea and in ukraine have brought about a situation where president obama and nato correctly i believe are saying you know what were going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched that he is not going to get away with aggressive action i happen to believe that putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and hes trying to rally his people in support of him but bottom line is the president is right we have to put more money we have to work with nato to protect eastern europe against any kind of russian aggression sanders well with respect to syria i really do appreciate the efforts that secretary kerry has made the agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout syria the agreement on a ceasefire though is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the russians agreed to you know the russians wanted to buy time are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the assad regime to further decimate whats left of the opposition which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual ceasefire so i know secretary kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that ceasefire up as quickly as possible but i would add this you know the security council finally got around to adopting a resolution at the core of that resolution is an agreement i negotiated in june of 2012 in geneva which set forth a ceasefire and moving toward a political resolution trying to bring the parties at stake in syria together this is incredibly complicated because weve got iran as a big player in addition to russia we have saudi arabia turkey and others who have very important interests in their view this is one of the areas ive disagreed with senator sanders on who has called for iranian troops trying to end civil war in syria which i think would be a grave mistake putting iranian troops right on the border of the golan right next to israel would be a nonstarter for me trying to get iran and saudi arabia to work together as he has suggested in the past is equally a nonstarter so lets support what secretary kerry and the president are doing but lets hope that we can accelerate the ceasefire because i fear that the russians will continue their bombing try to do everything they can to destroy whats left of the opposition and remember the russians have not gone after isis or any of the other terrorist groups so as we get a ceasefire and maybe some humanitarian corridors that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in syria turkey lebanon jordan and the like so weve got some real work to do and lets try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the russians applause sanders let me just just say this for a start the secretary and i disagree and i think the president does not agree with her in terms of the concept of a nofly zone in syria i think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there as i mentioned a moment ago i applaud secretary kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement lets hope that it holds sanders but furthermore what we have got to do im sorry yes i do believe that we have got to do everything that we can and it will not happen tomorrow but i do hope that in years to come just as occurred with cuba 10 20 years ago people would say reach normalized relations with cuba and by the way i hope we can end the trade embargo with cuba as well but the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with iran maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world yes that is something i want to achieve and i believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive to be principled but to have the goal of trying to improve relations thats how you make peace in the world you sit down and you work with people you make demands of people in this case demanding iran stop the support of international terrorism applause clinton well i respectfully disagree i think we have achieved a great deal with the iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the iranian nuclear weapons program that has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement i do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with iran yes they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism yes they have to stop trying to destabilize the middle east causing even more chaos yes theyve got to get out of syria theyve got to quit sponsoring hezbollah and hamas they have got to quit trying to ship rockets into gaza that can be used against israel we have a lot of work to do with iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us applause sanders we have a lot of work to do we have a lot of work to do but i recall when secretary clinton ran against thensenator obama she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to iran that you want to talk to our enemies i have no illusion of course you are right iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world destabilizing areas everybody knows that but our goal is in fact to try over a period of time to in fact deal with our enemies not just ignore that reality crosstalk clinton senator sanders from a debate in 2008 quote what i said the question was would you meet with an adversary without conditions i said no and in fact in obama administration we did not meet with anybody without conditions that is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking applause sanders no i think the idea was that president thensenator obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents its easier to talk to your friends its harder to talk to your enemies i think we should do both applause ifill let me move on you have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in syria and in libya more than a million refugees entered europe in 2015 another 76000 just last month that is about 2000 arrivals every day nearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year crossing the mediterranean and there are reports that 10000 children are missing if we are leaders in this world where should the us be on this what should the united states be doing secretary clinton clinton well i was pleased that nato announced just this week that theyre going to start doing patrols in the mediterranean in the aegean to try to interdict the smugglers to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the european union and its especially significant that they are working with both turkey and greece in order to do this with respect to the united states i think our role in nato our support for the eu as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country we should be doing our part and we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to turkey and to members of the eu in particular clinton this is a humanitarian catastrophe there is no other description of it so we do as the united states have to support our friends our allies in europe we have to stand with them we have to provide financial support to them we have to provide the nato support to back up the mission that is going on and we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves sanders a couple of years ago i had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation and i went to one of these turkish refugee camps right on the border of syria and what a sad sight that was men women children forced out of their homes and turkey by the way did a very decent thing providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people it seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed for the downtrodden that i very strongly disagree with those republican candidates who say you know what weve got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing nothing at all that is not what america is supposed to be about so i believe that working with europe and by the way you know weve got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world you got kuwait and you got qatar and you got saudi arabia they have a responsibility as well but i think this is a worldwide that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis were seeing from syria and afghanistan as well applause woodruff and we have a final question from our facebook family and it goes to senator sanders it comes from robert andrews hes a 40yearold stayathome dad in dover massachusetts he says the world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history can you name two leaders one american and one foreign who would influence your foreign policy decisions and why do you see them as why are they influential sanders you know franklin delano roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the american people were unemployed country was in incredible despair and he stood before the american people and he said the only thing we have to fear is fear itself a profound statement that gave the american people the courage to believe that yes we could get out of that terrible depression and then what he did is redefine the role of government you know you had herbert hoover before that saying no we got to only worry about the deficit so what if mass unemployment exists so what if children are going hungry thats not the role of the government and when fdr said yeah it is that were going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs to build homes to feed people to protect the farmers we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish and kind of thats what i see our campaign is about right now in this particular moment of serious crises saying to the american people dont give up on the political process dont listen to the trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us if we reengage and get involved yeah we can have health care for all people we can make public colleges and universities tuitionfree we do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality in the same light as the foreign leader winston churchills politics were not my politics he was kind of a conservative guy in many respects but nobody can deny that as a wartime leader he rallied the british people when they stood virtually alone against the nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory those are two leaders that i admire very much applause clinton i certainly agree with fdr for all the reasons senator sanders said and i agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world i would choose nelson mandela for his generosity of heart his understanding of the need for reconciliation clinton but i want to i want to follow up on something having to do with leadership because you know today senator sanders said that president obama failed the presidential leadership test and this is not the first time that he has criticized president obama in the past he has called him weak he has called him a disappointment he wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers remorse when it comes to president obamas leadership and legacy and i just couldnt agree disagree more with those kinds of comments you know from my perspective maybe because i understand what president obama inherited not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the republicans in congress i dont think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president applause clinton who got us out of that applause clinton put us on firm ground and has sent us into the future and it is a the kind of criticism that weve heard from senator sanders about our president i expect from republicans i do not expect from someone running for the democratic nomination to succeed president obama sanders that is applause sanders madam secretary that is a low blow i have worked with president obama for the last seven years when president obama came into office we were losing 800000 jobs a month 800000 jobs a month we had a 14 trillion deficit and the worlds financial system is on the verge of collapse as a result of his efforts and the efforts of joe biden against unprecedented i was there in the senate unprecedented republican obstructionism we have made enormous progress applause sanders but you know what last i heard we lived in a democratic society last i heard a united states senator had the right to disagree with the president including a president who has done such an extraordinary job so i have voiced criticisms youre right maybe you havent i have but i think to suggest that i have voiced criticism this blurb that you talk about you know what the blurb said the blurb said that the next president of the united states has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process thats what i said that is what i believe applause sanders president obama and i are friends as you know he came to vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator i have worked for his reelection his first election and his reelection but i think it is really unfair to suggest that i have not been supportive of the president i have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue do senators have the right to disagree with the president have you ever disagreed with a president i suspect you may have applause clinton you know senator what i am concerned about is not disagreement on issues saying that this is what i would rather do i dont agree with the president on that calling the president weak calling him a disappointment calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for reelection in 2012 you know i think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements as a senator yes i was a senator i understand we can disagree on the path forward but those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that i find particularly troubling ifill senator if you would like respond to you may respond to that but it is time for closing statements and you can use your time for closing statements to do that sanders well one of us ran against barack obama i was not that candidate applause sanders all right look this has been a great debate a lot of interesting issues have come together let me conclude by just saying this there is no president in my view not hillary clinton not bernie sanders who has the capability or the power to take on wall street large campaign donors the corporate media the big money interests in this country alone this campaign is not just about electing a president what this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of americans working people who have given up on the political process they dont think anybody hears their pains or their concerns young people for whom getting involved in politics is as you know its like going to the moon it aint going to happen low income people who are not involved in the political process sanders what this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent who today have so much economic and political power thank you all very much applause woodruff secretary clinton clinton you know we we agree that weve got to get unaccountable money out of politics we agree that wall street should never be allowed to wreck main street again but heres the point i want to make tonight i am not a single issue candidate and i do not believe we live in a singleissue country i think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back whether its poison in the water of the children of flint or whether its the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country or whether it is any other american today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism by sexism by discrimination against the lgbt community against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers thats what i want to take on and here in wisconsin i want to reiterate weve got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before applause the american middle class and who are being attacked by ideologues by demagogues yes does wall street and big financial interests along with drug companies insurance companies big oil all of it have too much influence youre right but if we were to stop that tomorrow we would still have the indifference the negligence that we saw in flint we would still have racism holding people back we would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay we would still have lgbt people who get married on saturday and get fired on monday and we would still have governors like scott walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions so im going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of americans fulfilling their potential because i dont think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single american to live up to theirs applause ifill thank you thank you senator clinton thank you senator sanders we also want to thank our partners at facebook and our hosts here at the university of wisconsin milwaukee applause woodruff and we want to thank our audience our quiet audience here in helen bader concert hall and to all of you watching at home thank you all stay tuned for analysis of the debate and the overall race for the democratic nomination thats coming up next here on pbs stations and online at pbsorgnewshour ifill im going to remain here in milwaukee tomorrow evening for a special edition of washington week here on pbs woodruff and im going to be returning to washington i hope youll join us for the pbs newshour tomorrow and every night thats it from all of us here in milwaukee we thank you ifill good night

upsetting and disturbing it was really devastating but also disgusting i think what i realized is that there was a side of matt i never really knew she revealed and i tried to understand why he behaved the way he he did and why he was so reckless and callous and honestly abusive to other women couric also explained that she and lauer who helmed the morning show together for more than a decade now have no relationship within the book itself which reportedly includes text messages between couric and lauer from the time of the allegations couric writes i know matt thinks i betrayed him

olympics in 2014 on assignment for nbc a statement released by nbc news stated that matt lauers conduct was appalling horrific and reprehensible as we said at the time thats why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint our hearts break again for our colleague splash news matt lauer in sag harbor on january 22 2018 in a statement to variety through his lawyer lauer denied

and failing to fact check his sources in the book lauer denied nevilss version of events as presented in the book at the time of publication and in his mediaite piece accused farrow of bias against nbc the piece lauer noted was originally intended to publish in november 2019 shortly after farrows book release but was delayed instead coming on the heels of a story in the new york times which also criticized farrows methods lauer has also accused farrow of sensationalism misleading language and presenting stories in a way that would suit his activist goals as opposed to any kind of journalistic standards farrow responded to lauers piece on twitter saying simply all ill say on this is that matt lauer is just wrong catch and kill was thoroughly reported and factchecked including with matt lauer himself lauer made similar denials in 2018 in april of 2018 the disgraced anchor made a statement to the washington post in which he said i have made no public comments on the many false stories from anonymous or biased sources that have been reported about me over these past several months i remained silent in an attempt to protect my family from further embarrassment and to restore a small degree of the privacy they have lost but defending my family now requires me to speak up i fully acknowledge that i acted inappropriately as a husband father and principal at nbc however i want to make it perfectly clear that any allegations or reports of coercive aggressive or abusive actions on my part at any time are absolutely false getty images savannah guthrie matt lauer and hoda kotb in

that lauer will not be appearing on the cable news network the announcement which came via an internal broadcast to cnn employees according to page six appears to have been a direct result of lauer making a rare public appearance at zuckers birthday celebration zucker previously served as an executive at nbc including a stint as executive producer on the today show while lauer was at the helm and the two are said to have remained friends even after parting ways professionally combined with his appearance at zuckers party this prompted some to speculate that lauer might be planning a muchrumored return to the airwaves on cnn patrick mcmullan getty images jeff zucker matt lauer and al roker at an event for the metropolitan opera house in new york in 2009 in many ways the matt rumors seemed to make sense ratings on cnns morning show and across prime time have been flagging and perhaps matt could be brought back to revive the numbers and his own career at the same time one cnn insider reportedly told page six adding that some senior female staffers at the network already had plans to refuse to work with lauer there was palpable relief in the office after jeff confirmed

the shows run fans were quick to point out that lauer who served on the show for 20 of its 25 year run was notably missing from the clips opinions were divided on whether or not lauer deserved to be in the anniversary video while some felt that lauers behavior should disqualify him from being publicly acknowledgedthank you for not including matt lauer you did the right thing one twitter user wroteothers felt that despite the allegations his long service on the show should not have been glossed over another twitter fan argued amazing that a member of the family was totally excluded from the 25th anniversary of studio 1a i know there were serious issues with matt lauer and his conduct is not to ever be condoned but all families are flawed in some way arent they history shouldnt be erased lauer wasnt the only former face of the show to be omitted from the anniversary though viewers also noted that ann curry who served as lauers coanchor from 2011 to 2012 also did not appear in any of the clips chosen for the anniversary curry was unexpectedly forced out of her role on today in 2012 a removal in which lauer himself reportedly had a hand leaving a particularly bitter taste in

gossipcop-624803233,0,bryce dallas howard earning 2m less than chris pratt for jurassic world is no scandal universal as noted in variety chris pratt will be receiving 10 million for his work in universalcomcast corps jurassic world fallen kingdom while bryce dallas howard will be getting 8 million as i wrote on tuesday it was a surprisingly solid example of relative parity yes ten is more than eight and both actors costarred in the last jurassic world movie but this was a case of franchisespecific value versus proven star power and then coming out mostly even i was pleasantly surprised and chalked it up as a win those considering it a moral outrage or an example of genderbased pay disparity are treating a victory as a defeat that she got anywhere near pratts salary for the second jurassic world movie counts as a sign that this conversation is having a positive effect if we were basing salary on proven star power and buttsintheseats value pratt would be making a lot more than howard regardless of whose story it was or who was the better actor that its even a close call is a relative victory for those wanting more money and better roles for actresses if you recall jurassic world was technically claires story she is our introductory character and she is the one who has a somewhat wobbly character arc whereby she realizes that the animals that she merely treated as commodities were fleshandblood creatures and thus were capable of unpredictable and uncontrollable actions pratts owen was the costar with similar screentime and most of the action beats but it wasnt necessarily his journey that she came back at all for the sequel means the filmmakers realized that i was actually relieved that howard was asked to return considering the long history of big franchises mission impossible the hangover indiana jones the 1990s batman sequels etc treating their female leads like disposable items this has gotten better in our current serialization era but its still an issue especially for standalone pictures and comedies that she and pratt both returned meant the filmmakers were aware that while pratts postlego movieguardians of the galaxy popularity was a big part of the films initial success it was not his movie there was little chance that pratt and howard were going to end up with the same relative paycheck for the second film chris pratt is a proven box office draw not just in the mcu but relatively speaking the likes of sonys passengers where he correctly got 60 of jennifer lawrences 20 million payday and the magnificent seven howard is a fine actress with terrific turns in the village the help and petes dragon among others but jurassic world was her first leading role in a major franchise youll remember that part of the prerelease campaign for jurassic world was a comedic video where howard sings about being mistaken for jessica chastain you could argue that its an example of gender disparity that actors like pratt get thrust from nearobscurity into a bunch of big franchise flicks and are then anointed movie stars when those films perform well or rehabilitate their image as an indie darling if those tentpoles bomb youd be 104 correct thats a big factor in genderbased pay disparity you command a bigger salary from wellreceived and successful star vehicles which you cant accumulate if youre always playing the girlfriendhostage to less famous male actors or the one woman in a sausagefest hence michelle williams being willing to reshoot sonys all the money in the world essentially for scale while wahlberg a major movie star with the ability to walk away to his next starring vehicle held out for 15 million after ridley scott replaced kevin spacey with christopher plummer for wahlberg it was just another studio job a rare supporting role for a regular leading man but for williams it was the opposite a rare starring role in a major studio film for an actress used to headlining indies or playing the wifelove interest in studio pictures any number of white male actors are given the opportunity to build a healthy resume of acclaimed or financially successful starring vehicles and thus gain a reputation for solid leading man turns even if most of those film are either indies or failed studio flicks even if josh brolin ryan gosling or tom hardy cant open an envelope outside of ipdriven franchises they are respected thespians and they get paid partially for the prestige and respectability that they bring to a project its why gosling got 65 million for first man and why hardy got 7m for venom its harder for women to build up a resume that generates big paydays with the neardeath of the romantic comedy legal thriller and adult drama even many femalecentric releases the force awakens frozen jurassic world contain one or two major female characters add a cultural disposition to view actresses as being inferior actors how many strong performances is blake lively going to give before we count her as a decent actress oh and add the advantage for white male actors being able to prove and reprove their worth in indie flicks or prestige tv see mcconaughey matthew i would argue that bringing back bryce dallas howard for fallen kingdom was vital in establishing this fifth film as more than just random dino movie with the word jurassic in the title movietomovie continuity counts which is why shia labeouf made three transformers movies that along with the optics at play is part of why howard who hadnt headlined a major studio hit since the village in 2004 which was mostly sold falsely as a joaquin phoenix vehicle before 2015 got 8 million while her more famous and more bankable costar got 10m there are absurd cases where wellknown actresses or sportscasters are paid less for relative equal work compared to their lessfamous male costars think jennifer lawrence making less than jeremy renner for american hustle just as i still find it outrageous how often we see a scenario where amy adams plays garrett hedlands girlfriend and a major part of the problem is an industry where there are far more opportunities for ashton kutcher to prove that hes a reliable box office draw than natalie portman thus financially justifying him getting three times what she made for no strings attached but as frustrating as it must be not every example of a woman being paid less for movie or tv work is an example genderbased discrimination i was shocked in a good way that bryce dallas howard a made 8 million for jurassic world fallen kingdom and b made just 20 less than her much more box office draw costar its a relative victory and a sign that the conversation is having a positive effect ms howard doesnt need you to make her out into a victim you already forced her to ditch her snazzy high heels

blackpeopleneedtostopsupportingtheprejudice david crottypatrick mcmullan via getty charles sykesbravonbcu photo bank via getty in addition leakes shared the recently resurfaced video of brielle on her own instagram account this time bringing up kylie jenners name briellebiermann we dont have roaches if you found 1 u brought it with u or it fell outta yo funky p please know i will get you all the way together when you start fing with me and mine leakes wrote in the comments section go somewhere and let the air outta those fake lips fake titties and fake ass because you will never be kylejenner yo trashy mama should have taught you better my home is brand new but you guys were so jealous of it you couldnt even give a compliment you had to stoop so low and be so disgusting racisttrash she concluded a rep for bravo had no comment instagram also on thursday brielle responded in the comment section of her own instagram post after a follower accused her of calling leakes a black roach im not calling black people roaches i found a roach in nenes home not calling her a roach dumb f doesnt matter if youre black white hispanic asian etc you can still have roaches in ur house if u dont fing clean ur s callorkinpls the eldest biermann child wrote instagram then leakes responded in the comments of a separate instagram account calling the biermann duo racists kim her daughter oops whole family are racists what her daughter did at my home which she nor kim were invited to so be clear abt that as well was pure disgusting racist learned behavior etc leakes wrote adding children are not off limits when you allow your child to talk to adults any kind of way post disrespectful things on social media and so on kim is a calculating bio polar racist with a horrible mouth who uses black folks for her come up zolciakbiermann 39 told her side of the story to defend brielle saying rhoa fans and viewers will soon see the bug incident play out on the upcoming season first off that video is a combination of 2 videos i combined them brielle posted the first video on snap unaware of the large bug in front of her when she was kneeling down until her dms blew up she removed the video immediately i was filming as an invited guest at neneleakes for rhoa brielle was invited as well the mother of six wrote on instagram brielle went to the bathroom and saw several bugs and had sent me the video on snap and no one else we are filming a show remember that rhoa and nene released this video herself no one has ever seen this video but rhoa nobody would have ever seen this video nene has said and done some things that are absolutely disgusting however i will take the high road as you will see it on the show soon enough but you will not make it seem as though my daughter did anything wrong she never posted this video nor would she as you see here i myself was not willing to send the video just for ratings for rhoa end of story zolciakbiermann concluded in a followup post zolciakbiermann wrote a lengthy statement its so sad and offensive that someone can stoop so low as to call someone a racist just because they are mad everyone in my life knows that i am far from racist and unfortunately nene leaks has tried for the last 10 years to paint that picture because thats her last resort its convenient that im not racist when we are getting along she said in a day and age where racism is very much alive and people are actually dying because of real racists its heartbreaking that nene would cry wolf like this only because shes upset i think everyone including nene needs to spend some time uplifting people insted of tearing them down nene should be embracing love instead of making up lies there is absolutely no credibility to anything that she has said i will not stand for these slanderous comments httpswwwinstagramcompbz4uxglhkh9takenbyneneleakes later leakes retorted zolciakbiermanns post with another statement of her own kim zolciak is the one that sent the video to cynthia sheree marlo porsha and kandi while we were filming in spain now she has the nerve to make a pitty post no one from kims household was invited to my white party kim came as sherees plus 1 she is a huge lier leakes wrote all this season i have done nothing but try an be kind to her even when she said disrespectful things to me and broke glasses in my home i still continue to be kind to her but this calculated video that was shot in my home during a time when we had no problems shows how low she will really go then she turns around an try to get the fans on her side of this s trash the drama escalated yet again after fellow rhoa cast member kenya moore also commented on the leakesbiermann feud neneleakes i totally agree with you about that devil moore said in her

politifact11416,1,did bernie sanders vote against background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases as hype around democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders grows political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist vermont senator is a gun nut one issue your democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have in the past sided with the nra on some gun issues cnns jake tapper said in a july 5 interview with sanders alluding to an attack ad paid for by a promartin omalley group bernie sanders voted against the brady bill background checks and waiting periods said the attack which first aired june 25 bernie sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns sanders record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire bernie sanders gun nut as well as conservative glee sorry liberals bernie sanders is a gun nut so we wanted to take a look at his vote on the brady handgun violence prevention act a landmark piece of gun control legislation the brady act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks after 1998 the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks sign up for politifact texts but before brady became law it underwent many transformations sanders elected to the house of representatives in 1990 voted on it numerous times virtually almost always in opposition in may 1991 sanders voted against a version that mandated a sevenday waiting period for background checks but the bill passed in the house the senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the house in nov 1991 sanders voted against that version though it passed in the house the senate didnt muster enough votes the brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992 after some back and forth a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period in november 1993 sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead seen by some as pointless as the technology for instant checks didnt exist at the time he also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why the final compromise version of the brady bill an interim fiveday waiting period while installing an instant background check system was passed and signed into law on nov 30 1993 sanders voted against it according to sanders campaign manager jeff weaver sanders reason for opposing the brady bill was twofold first he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach and second he was doing his job he wasnt opposed to states having waiting periods if they wanted to the republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them and bernie voted that down weaver said he said he would be against waiting periods and he kept his word to the people of vermont in april 1991 sanders thenchief of staff anthony pollina echoed the idea that sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents bernies response is that he doesnt just represent liberals and progressives he was sent to washington to present all of vermont pollina said its not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position particularly on something vermonters have been very clear about the green mountain state though leftleaning has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws as well as a low homicide rate that and sanders own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record experts told us as a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues historically explained bertram johnson a professor of political science at middlebury college in vermont he seems to support more regulation of guns than the us presently has but he recognizes his constituents preferences so does not make gun control a priority i think he has disappointed many progressives in vermont with his gun positions which sort of walk a middle line and angering both sides through the years said chris graff the former vermont associated press bureau chief gun control is a tough issue in vermont for all politicians former vermont gov howard dean whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to sanders 2016 run received high marks from the national rifle association vermont democratic sen patrick leahy also voted against the brady bill for his part sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time and to protect second amendment rights the other half here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in congress bold reflects a progun control position year legislation sanders vote result 1993 imposes a fiveday waiting period and background checks on firearm purchases part of the brady bill nay passed 1993 imposes instant

suppleness and evolution since those first brady votes and added he isnt a gun lobby lapdog experts agreed that on guns sanders views are to the right of his democratic rivals when it comes to guns hes not ted cruz but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than martin omalley or hillary clinton said eric davis who studies vermont politics at middlebury college guns are not an important issue for him because they dont fit into the classbased framework that bernie looks at politics through our ruling an attack ad said bernie sanders voted against the brady bill background checks and waiting periods the brady bill imposed a fiveday waiting period for wouldbe purchasers of handguns between 1991 and 1993 sanders voted against it five times he did however vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks and against an amendment that repealed state background checks experts noted sanders votes were representative of vermonts gun owners and gun laws since the 1990s his record on gun control is mixed we rate the ads claim mostly true

one massive bombshell kim ravers teddy returned to support old friendcrush owen kevin mckidd and his former pow sister megan abigail spencer with the latter setting up a new love triangle that involved meredith ellen pompeo and nathan martin henderson owen planted a longawaited kiss on teddy who with his mother and sister agreed that his wife amelia caterina scorsone was just not his person head of neuro amelia meanwhile delivered the premieres biggest stunner as she learned in the closing moments that she had a brain tumor april sarah drew realized its time to move out of exhusbandbaby daddy jacksons jesse williams place despite her feelings for him while he pursued maggie kelly mccreary jo camilla luddington and alex justin chambers patched things up with her estranged and violent husband paul matthew morrison still looming if the couple really want to get married ben jason george admitted to feeling a rush when he helped save stephanie jerrika hinton in the season 13 finale as the series set the stage for the character to segue over to the firefighter spinoff after eliza marika dominczyk ghosted her arizona jessica capshaw got her groove back again with andrews giacomo gianniotti italian sister carina stefania spampinato whose study about the female orgasm helped reveal amelias tumor peppered in among all the twists and turns were several nods to the past including multiple references to mers late mom ellis kate burton and nods to george tr knight derek patrick dempsey callie sara ramirez and a photo of cristina sandra oh in a medical journal the blasts from the past and return to its classic humor came from krista vernoff shameless who returned to the abc shondaland medical drama as the coshowrunner after helping to launch greys as part of its core writing staff for its first seven seasons below vernoff opens up about season 14s eventful start and where abcs top drama goes next the first two hours are really eventful how much of that is setting the new pace of greys vs setting the stage for the season to come setting the stage there were a lot of nods to the past we see cristinas photo and theres a reference to george why was it important to acknowledge the past im not sure that it was important so much as it felt natural to me i think its a little bit like im back so they are too also we are doing the 300th episode this year i think i came into the season planning to acknowledge where it all started webber points out a few times how similar meredith is to ellis is that part of bringing the show back to its origins or part of looking forward to a potential alzheimers story its neither it just felt really organic for a man who grew up with the mother of the woman he is now working with to acknowledge similarities and even be a little haunted by them also meredith has a surgical birthright that we are leaning into this season this is the season of meredith being something of a medical superhero like ellis was theres a lot of humor in the first two episodes all that was missing was a seriously is bringing that humor back part of a larger effort to bring the show back to its roots its not about the roots so much as where my heart lives right now im not interested in writing darkness i feel like the world has gone dark enough i feel like we who are part of the resistance right now need some relief in our entertainment i feel like its part of my personal activism to help people sit down and laugh at night so they can get back up in the morning and fight the good fight theres a parallel between megan returning home and creating the triangle with nathan and meredith to when addison returned and created the same for derek and meredith will you be exploring that more thats interesting and it honestly hadnt even occurred to me no i dont want to give away too much but i am writing this story very differently is there a potential for abigail spencer and kim raver to stick around longer maybe series regular status this season if i had the budget for it i would bring them both back forever immediately they are incredible talents and its a joy to write for them and to work with them amelia has a brain tumor talk about the decision to go that route does that explain her behavior last season too whats the larger story youre looking at with her when i caught up on the show i thought amelia had been behaving really oddly it got my wheels turning and this is where they landed has owen given up on his marriage to amelia when he kisses teddy i believe that he has which is why when he learns that a brain tumor may be the answer for how amelias been treating him it will be really complicated how might meredith respond to amelias tumor is there a place where she goes dark and twisty again no meredith has already survived too much to return to dark and twisty i really believe that i believe that as people survive the unimaginable they tend to get lighter because they know now that they can survive anything unless they go completely the opposite direction which meredith happily has not jo and alex are moving forward and paul is coming back where do they go from here and what will that look like i cant answer that without giving away too much but i will say for all my talk of light and hope and joy that it wouldnt be greys anatomy if there were not some dark and twisty turns here and there ben felt a rush from saving stephanie how will he lean into that and what does that mean for bailey well since its been announced that jason george is going to the firefighting show i think everyone can anticipate how hes leaning into that and as you can imagine that is an extremely complicated thing for bailey to process it makes for great drama and chandra wilson is so incredible im really enjoying writing it april is moving out of jacksons apartment as he has interest in maggie will he fight for her april is moving out of jacksons apartment because it is causing her pain to continue living with the man she divorced when she thought she recognized feelings between jackson and maggie she realized that living with a man you still love but are divorced from is maybe not the smartest thing to do i feel like its a really beautiful grownup move from april i also think that there were not necessarily feelings between maggie and jackson last season i think her jealousy led her to that conclusion but when she said it she opened a kind of pandoras box i think it will be a lot of fun to see how it all plays out arizona and carina are really funny together with andrew how will this relationship be different for arizona this is a season of fun and carina brings so much fun because i am antispoiler thats all im going to give you on that greys anatomy airs thursdays at 8

gossipcop-887667,1,which is the best crazy exgirlfriend opening credits sequence so far earlier this week crazy exgirlfriends season 3 opening credits sequence was finally revealed online in the new sequence which makes its official debut in tonights episode rebecca bunch cocreator and star rachel bloom takes on several pop star personas channeling different strains of crazy a carrie underwoodtype swinging a louisville slugger a sultry diva whos crazy in love a rock star who likes a woman whos crazy in bed and a rapper who warns you to stay away from a girl whos crazy in the head to be crazy or not to be crazy thats the question at the center of the theme but of course theres no clear answerthe personalities conflict and a cut at the end to rebecca herself sitting on the toilet and watching it all go down on her phone reveals shes more confused than ever honestly the whole thing is confusing to me too the song which feels clearly inspired by underwoods before he cheats is disjointed and plodding flying by quickly and ending abruptly it never really registers as a cohesive opener and thats probably the pointbloom told e that pops obsession with the word crazy inspired the aesthetic its probably the most common word used in pop music and if youre like my character whos trying to live her life by those things it would be very confusing to get guidelines from listening to different pop songs its a great concept especially considering that season 3 is where crazy exgirlfriend officially begins to earn its title with rebecca seeking the utmost revenge on josh after hes left her at the altar but the execution is unsatisfyingthis is also the season that is filtering its motif through movie tropes bloom has described it as funny fatal attraction and the second episode airing tonight includes a 50 shades of grey plot line and a musical ode to gene kelly and the pop theme is jarringly inconsistent in this light also its just not that catchy advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement the season 1 opening credits sequence is catchy and does what so many of the best tv theme songs have done it cleverly lays out the shows premise in a way that complements the script and the spirit of the season rebeccas rash decision to move her entire life from new york city to west covina ca after running into her summercamp boyfriend from high school is breezily chronicled in the lyrics and then instantly commented upon by the chorus shes the crazy exgirlfriend what no im not rebecca is in denial for everyone herself included and this plays out slowly throughout the season until she finally attempts to seek therapy for her mental health issues and admits to josh aloud that she made the move explicitly for him the theme is subversive and provocative cheerful and animated while revealing our protagonist to be more than a little not ok in delivery its spoton and season 1 does in fact live up to its promiseits take on the crazy woman trope is a lot more nuanced than that advertisement advertisement season 2s theme however raised the bar for what crazy exgirlfriend could convey in a mere 30 seconds in the busby berkeleyinspired musical number rebecca sings innocently about just being a girl in love who cant be held responsible for my actions shes certifiably cute and adorably obsessed its perfect from beginning to end a bubbly singalong that belies rebeccas darker deeper spiral into willful ignorance of her problems and how those problems affect those around her the chorus members call her an ingenuefitting since the season is all about taking the romantic comedy genres celebration of doing outrageous things in the name of love and exposing it for the disturbing mess it can actually be in real life paula questions her friendship with rebecca whose selfishness leaves her high and dry when she needs her most rebecca runs over joshs new girlfriends cat and that final moment of rebeccas head busting blam through the heartshaped image of joshs face with the camera lingering for just a beat longer than feels comfortableif season 1 rebecca was charming and highly functional while still exhibiting a steady loss of control season 2 rebecca is much more unsettling in the most fascinating of ways advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement held up against these two previous examples season 3s theme is a bit of a letdown it makes smart pointswomen are frequently told that one of the worst things to be is crazy except when in bed with a man and then its encouragedbut doesnt really subvert them through imagery one would expect something at least a bit more fun coming from joseph kahn the director behind the music video for the thong song based on the three new episodes ive seen it doesnt seem like cause to worry for the fate of this season as crazy exgirlfriend is still very much a delightful and thoughtprovoking journey but when the four strains of crazy pop stars collectively offer we hope this helps to rebecca its hard not to answer with no no it does not

in upper canada who finds herself accused of murdering her employer in 1843 a cbc and netflix original production the miniseries was written and produced by sarah polley directed by mary harron and won the canadian screen award for best limited series need to know more about alias grace atwood spoke to cbc twice about the novel in 1996 on the tv program midday which you can watch above and the cbc radio program morningside which you can listen to at the bottom of this post here are six things that inspired the classic novel 1 the writings of susanna moodie alias grace represents atwoods fascination with the tale after reading author susanna moodies account of the murders in the 1853 book life in the clearing moodie best known for roughing it in the bush wrote about marks case in life in the clearing although many of the details moodie reported were later revealed to be inaccurate atwood read life in the clearing while she was a student at harvard university i was intrigued the report of it that i first read was susanna moodies book life in the clearing moodie recounts seeing marks in the kingston penitentiary she then takes the occasion to tell the whole account atwood has been intrigued by the story ever since in fact she penned a play called the servant girl and based on susanna moodies version of the grace marks first the play was filmed for cbctv and released in 1974 22 years before alias grace was published 2 the known facts of the 19th century case in 1843 irish immigrant and teenager grace marks was sentence to life in prison for murdering her wealthy employer thomas kinnear and his pregnant housekeeper and mistress nancy montgomery james mcdermott a stable hand was also convicted for the murders and was hanged due to the sensational details of the

penitentiary in alias grace atwood draws out the tantalizing did she or didnt she question that once fixated the public when writing the historical novel atwood wanted to avoid bending the facts to create her narrative as a result alias grace is grounded in as much truth as she could find the newspaper quotes and excerpts at the beginning of the book chapters were taken from real sources if youre dealing with things that actually are known you cant arbitrarily change that to suit yourself atwood said 3 grace marks karla holmolka and how society views female criminals the trial of paul bernardo and karla homolka were happening around the same time atwood was writing alias grace while atwood didnt follow the trial all that closely she was fascinated by how the public reacts to female criminals differently than male criminals in murders in which there are a man and a woman involved public opinion usually goes in the following fashion everybody is agreed on the man but opinion is usually split about the woman one side she instigated it all shes the female demon the other side she is an innocent victim coerced by force circumstance and fear atwood said to cbc thats how it split on karla and it was certainly how it spilt on grace 4 the power of dreams and repressed memories atwood was fascinated by the concept of dreams and the subconscious dreaming plays a major role in alias grace dreams repressed memories hypnosis and the human mind all play key components of the compelling story this novel is set in the victorian period a period this you might say is the period of dreams its when they become very important i think dreams are part of peoples lives and if you are going to show a character you have to show their dreams there was a huge interest into the workings of the mind at that time 5 how history repeats itself the 19th century story of grace marks says a lot of about todays class society according to atwood we are hurtling back towards the 19th century we seem to be making choices with a small class of very rich people and a large class of very poor people whose labour will therefore be very cheap in the first part of the 21st century there was an attempt to get away from that but now we seem determined to go back to it we should as people have a good look at how it played out then and whether we really want to go back 6 how we tell stories atwood is a storyteller alias grace was her ninth novel when it came out in 1996 and shes interested in not only telling stories but why and how we tell stories the novel is partly about stories how they are constructed how they are influenced by the circumstances surrounding them who is telling who is listening and why in fact readers should keep that in mind when reading the book and deciding whether grace is innocent or guilty shes telling the story to somebody who might help her get out and if you were in that position and you were talking to someone who might help you get out what sort of light would you represent yourself in atwood has come to her own conclusion on the guilt or innocence of grace marks but shes not telling anyone the maddening thing about history is that it can leave out the things you most want to know she said but i havent concealed any hidden piece of evidence that tells all

gossipcop-925384,1,alyson stoner taps into her sexuality with fool in 2017 alyson stoner released a very seofriendly youtube video called what happened to alyson stoner in it she expressed her frustration with getting the same questions asked of her over and over by fans and press alike as a former child star known for acting and dancing roles in disney shows films like cheaper by the dozen and missy elliotts iconic work it music video stoner now 25 is often tasked with explaining where she is now no i did not die she says in the video from last year instead she graduated high school at 14 has appeared in over 150 movies voiced several animated characters traveled internationally as both an activist and a performer and more recently came out as queer now poised with a new single fool and a growing instagram following stoner is looking to move back into the spotlight that had to begin she says with a realization that the image she was projecting to the world was not exactly her you know art is supposed to be raw raw expression but i grew up in a very commercialized mainstream platform stoner tells into so ive always carried a bit of an inner diplomat and technician in my songwriting and performances which makes things a little careful and curated maybe digestible but like boring because its not necessarily honest and i reached a point several months ago where i put it up to my team that i really believe the genuine alyson is more interesting and capable than the persona weve been maintaining in a world obsessed with transformations stoner is recreating her own image and this time she says shes in control i have now been unlocking parts of myself and sharing them in essays in interviews and podcasts and its funny because people of course have to take their time to adjust but i at least know that when im stopped by fans on the street the conversations are different now she says its not about someone idolizing an unobtainable figure its about someone who found themselves in my story and that is the kind of connection that ive always longed for but i myself have been too timid to tap into part of stoners story is her sexual fluidity which she talked about for the first time this spring in a teen vogue essay about falling for a woman i alyson am attracted to men women and people who identify in other ways she wrote i can love people of every gender identity and expression it is the soul that captivates me it is the love we can build and the goodness we can contribute to the world by supporting each others best journeys over the weekend stoner appeared at her first glaad event since coming out presenting an award to bornperfects mathew shurka as her personal platform grows so does her visibility as a now openly queer lgbtq activist and artist something other out public figures might consider a doubleedged sword people believe that im sharing my sexuality because its more popular now she says im sure i could have created some controversy and maybe have gotten more attention and more streams but i dont want to look back and feel like i could have been more sensitive to people watching stoners brand is largely positivity optimism mental health selfexpression and perhaps most importantly engagement most of her instagram posts ask for commenters to share their own feelings thoughts or memories or even their choice of emoji shes often quick to respond to them indivudally offering personalized connections as best she can but with fool a song that she says has a sexuality and a sensuality to it that has been scary for her to tap into her concern is that shes moving into a new rawer direction that might be offputting yeah im just like a nunfeeling lonely as fuckand i want youon the floor on the chair i dont careanywhere that you want to she sings in her most explicit song yet even though shes an adult woman stoner is still working against the archetype set up for her the same that miley cyrus demi lovato and other former child stars have had to work against for me the song kind of only makes sense as a metaphor stoner says its when youre sleeping in when youre getting ready to go out when youre in the shower its someone kissing you down your spine its being held sinking into pillows driving down the coast so its all of these sensations and instead of creating an inspirational anthem i really wanted the song to be an invitation inside my senses despite being an accomplished dancer she frequently shares her moves on social media and has taught classes at the famed labased millennium dance complex stoner says she still struggles to be as in touch with her body as she wants to be and that relates both to her artistry and her sexuality she acknowledges the irony but has found a way through both to reconnect with herself it just happens to coincide with her reemergence into the public eye im one of the few in my generation who remained private about their personal life and generally pretty modest throughout my career so i also have the concern and responsibility of potentially disappointing people and being judged by fans who depend on me to stay in a certain box as much as id like to say my dance gave me an edge on people i actually feel the opposite but now because of the healing and therapy and learning to love and accept myself now i feel like im getting to experience life fully and you know i felt so good singing this song i want everyone who listens to feel as good as i do when im singing it of course coming out even in 2018 is considered risky for anyone who is selling the world on buying them as an individual stoner is still an actor but says in her 2017 video she prefers to tell her own stories now and as any former child star can attest to that wholesome and assumed heterosexual image can work against you once you grow older first and foremost my focus is on making sure i seek to understand other people before expecting to be understood she says and i understand that having a microphone automatically qualifies whatever the person says as expertise or things that can be later used against the person i dont think i can speak out about loving women and then not alienate certain people who disagree with that and i consider it a special honor to be able to participate in these conversations but i believe that my position hopefully always is going to be one of a student and i just simply dont i dont have peace with seeing injustice and discrimination and not doing everything in my capacity to understand how we got here and find a way to play mediator between the sides while happy to participate in conversations with the conservative fans who would rather remember her as a desexualized performer with kidfriendly messaging stoner says she doesnt take representing lgbtqs lightly its not a responsibility that i demand or expect but it does sometimes happen subsequently and i try my best to make sure im going above and beyond to find sources and people and build relationships in all of the communities on every side so that im informed she says so that when im making decisions and im speaking out on something i am not just following talking points that were given to me stoner says shes hoping followers will take the opportunity to get to know the real alyson now that shes ready to show them i dont think people know my heart and what i value and i think thats because i withheld that information and now through writing articles through performing i plan to be way more transparent i dont need people to know me perfectly i can never control their perceptions but i really do want people to know that im an ally for anyone whos trying to pursue wholeness images via getty

but was criticized for what was considered its lack of catharsis disorienting lighting and the anticlimactic ending of the white walker storyline that had been built up for seven seasons717273 the last of the starks and the bells were said to have rushed pacing writing and deviation from character development with the last of the starks being labeled as anticlimactic and a huge letdown79 the iron throne was described as divisive and according to rotten tomatoes the series finale represents a modest rebound but it went out with a whimper8081 the bells and the iron throne are the worstreviewed episodes of the entire series on the website with an approval of 49 and 48 respectively while the last four episodes of the season plunged to record low scores74828384 david sims of the atlantic wrote that the final season has been the same story over and over again a lot of tineared writing trying to justify some of the most drastic story developments imaginable as quickly as possible as usual the actors did their best with what was on the page80 lucy mangan of the guardian considered the season a rushed business it has wasted opportunities squandered goodwill and failed to do justice to its characters or its actors85 zack beauchamp of vox wrote that it dispensed almost entirely with trying to make sense of its characters internal motivationslet alone the complex political reality that its psychological realism initially helped create86 huw fullerton of radio times said the final season was not thrones at its best but still had some sort of ending for the characters for fullerton the season was like the finale some bits i liked one or two i loved an awful lot that leaves me scratching my head87 writing for usa today kelly lawler felt that the series ultimately betrayed its identity of tragedy and injustice with a pandering ending88 judy berman of time said that the series failed to complete the answer to conflicting ideas about freedom justice and leadership themes that had brought depth to the series89 ellen gray of the philadelphia inquirer and darren franich of entertainment weekly agreed that the final season was not as complex as previous seasons9091 franich stated that the broseph mentality shined through shunting the development and interaction between female characters franich criticized cersei for doing nothing this season regarding it one complete failure of imagination as well as the ultimate primary focus on the reactions and thoughts of the male characters such as jon snow the least complicated main character91 writing for the hollywood reporter maureen ryan condemned what she considered the seasons reductive treatment of women and decisions set up and executed with little or no foresight or thoughtfulness declaring the penultimate episode the bells as game of thrones at its worst92 the final season received comparisons to the 2003 fullmetal alchemist anime as both shows came up with original endings due to overtaking their source material939495 ratings edit audience response edit a petition to hbo for competent writers to remake the eighth season of game of thrones in a manner that makes sense was started on changeorg after the last of the starks aired but went viral after the bells aired and saw daeneryss arc take a significant turn102103 the petition described showrunners david benioff and d b weiss as woefully incompetent writers104105 by september 6 2019 it received over 173 million signatures106107 digital spy reported that some fans of the series criticized the season for the way it handled several character arcs and the rushed pacing108 the petitions creator stated that he never expected hbo to remake the season but saw the petition as a message of frustration and disappointment at its core106 the petition was labelled as disrespectful to the crew and the filmmakers by actress sophie turner who plays sansa stark109110 ridiculous weird juvenile by actor isaac hempstead wright who plays bran stark110111 rude by actor jacob anderson who plays grey worm112 and fandom extremism by actress carice van houten who plays melisandre113 emilia clarke who plays daenerys targaryen indicated she was previously unaware of the petition but gave a warmer response when she was asked what she would want to see happen if the eighth season were redone i can only speak to my own character and the people that i interact with on the show but i wouldve loved some more scenes with me and missandei i wouldve loved some more scenes with me and cersei114 richard roeper writing for the chicago suntimes wrote over all though it was a solid and largely satisfying wrapup to one of the most exciting and enthralling tv series ever115 in regards to the controversy he added over the last 25 years ive reviewed thousands of movies and dozens of tv shows and i dont think ive ever seen the level of fan and to a lesser degree critical vitriol leveled at this show in recent weeks however roeper noted that social media was not yet widely used during much of this time period115 author stephen king defended the final season saying ive loved this last season of got including dani going bugshit all over kings landing theres been a lot of negativity about the windup but i think its just because people dont want any ending but you know what they say all good things116 filmmaker joe russo during talks at google commented that he appreciated all the decisions and the choices that the makers took in season 8 he said they made the choices that they wanted to make with that show and people felt what i think that they felt was that they didnt feel it was seeded properly throughout the series i loved all the choices i thought they were crazy and unexpected and thats what i want out of a narrative but i see where people feel like they were upset117 lenika cruz writing for the atlantic wrote that with the end of the series there are folks who dont feel as though the hours and hours theyve devoted to this show have been wasted but there are many others who felt the opposite80 kelly lawler of usa today wrote that the ultimate ending of the series was not what some fans signed up for88 cbs news has described several plot points that some fans are dissatisfied with the character arcs of daenerys and jaime the fates of jaime missandei rhaegal and the night king the battle of winterfell being visually too dark the basic existence of euron greyjoy and jons treatment of ghost105 cast response edit in an interview with the new yorker emilia clarke said she had to hold back her innermost anxiety from beyonc i was just like oh my god my absolute idol in life is saying that she likes me and i know for a fact that by the end of this season shes going to hate me all i wanted to scream was please please still like me even though my character turns into a masskilling dictator please still think that im representing women in a really fabulous way114 clarke said she was shocked at daeneryss turn and her last scene because it comes out of nowhere although she stands by the character clarke said it was a struggle reading the scripts as for what she would have changed she said she would have liked more scenes between daenerys and missandei and daenerys and cersei i just think more dissection and those beautifully written scenes that the boys have between characters that we are more than happy to contently sit there and watch ten minutes of two people talking because its beautiful i just wanted to see a bit more of that118 in an interview published as the final season premiered kit harington said he felt defiant about the series at the time adding that whatever critic spends half an hour writing about this season and makes their negative judgement on it in my head they can go fuck themselves i know how much work was put into this now if people feel let down by this final season i dont give a fuck because everyone working on the series tried their hardest in the end no ones bigger fans of the show than we are119 harington later said he expected the ending was going to divide fans and he was concerned the final two episodes would be deemed sexist we have cersei and dany two leading women who fall the justification is just because theyre women why should they be the goodies theyre the most interesting characters in the show you cant just say the strong women are going to end up the good people its going to open up discussion and when have you ever seen a woman play a dictator harington also said he was disappointed his character jon did not kill the night king yet added it was a really great twist and it tied up maisies journey in a really beautiful way120 nathalie emmanuel who played missandei was heartbroken when she read her characters sudden demise i think the fact that she died in chains when she was a slave her whole life that for me was a pungent cut for that character that felt so painful emmanuel the only woman of color who was a regular cast member for the last several seasons said its safe to say that game of thrones has been under criticism for their lack of representation and the truth of it is that missandei and grey worm have represented so many people because theres only two of them121 emmanuel added that she wished she had more time or scenes this season maybe with daenerys or even with cersei scenes where we get to see her being brilliant before she dies i think that might have eased the pain a bit more for people and reinforcing a friendship that she and dany had because we havent really seen anything for a few seasons120 conleth hill who played varys told entertainment weekly that the seventh and eighth seasons were kind of frustrating and not his favorite noting that varys kind of dropped off the edge hill reacted with dismay to varys apparently losing his knowledge commenting if he was such an intelligent man and he had such resources how come he didnt know about things after being very bummed to not have a final scene with littlefinger hill was bummed not to have any reaction to littlefinger dying if he was varys nemesis also once the series ran out of book material as a source hill said that special niche interest in weirdos wasnt as effective as it had been however hill was not dissatisfied on the whole regarding the series122 lena headey had a mixed initial reaction to the manner of death for cersei lannister headey said she would rather have had cersei die by some big piece or fight with somebody fellow actor nikolaj costerwaldau and headey discussed it and then appreciated the scene viewing it as the perfect ending for cersei and jaime as they came into the world together and now they leave together123 headey mentioned that a scene of cerseis miscarriage was cut124125 sophie turner said she would like to have seen sansa and cersei reunited or arya and cersei but she was happy with the ending for her character120 maisie williams said the biggest regret for her character arya was not getting a scene with cersei and possibly killing her even if it means arya dies too she later embraced aryas happier arc for the last season126 gwendoline christie who played brienne said she was dismayed by her character turn explaining that it was partially because i read about this character in martins novels before i saw the show so we all have our own ideas about how we think the character is going to develop sometimes your ideas become set in your mind and sometimes david and dan write something you didnt expect and find difficult to comprehend she also noted that brienne has been very impactful in the way i think about women and in the way theyre portrayed in the media and the way theyre treated in society120 joe dempsie gendry also expressed disappointment over the series finale as did former cast members charles dance tywin lannister and natalia tena osha though dempsie also dismissed claims that benioff and weiss rushed the season saying working with them for a number of years i know the last thing they wanted is for almost a decade of work to be undone by a final season that

politifact14836,0,breaking trump fires deputy attorney general rod rosenstein raising questions over muellers fate washington rod jay rosenstein deputy attorney general for the united states department of justice has been removed from his office nearly everyone who knows him seems to agree that rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general and the official overseeing the special counsel robert muellers investigation of links between the trump campaign and russia has a reputation for integrity rod who is described by jim trusty the former head of the justice departments organizedcrime division as a prosecutor not a persecutor had sought earlier to protect his good image by not taking a hastened decision to fire anyone without justifiable reasons but trump could not fire mueller directly according to the law that authorizes muellers probe so the only possible way is to throw the justice department into upheaval by firing deputy attorney general rosenstein who only holds the key muellers expulsion only the person acting as attorney general and rod rosenstein who was on matters related to the probe could fire mueller and he said he wont do it without good cause so trump would first had to purge the upper ranks of the justice department until he finds someone willing to follow his orders and dismiss the special counsel conflicting reports claim rosenstein had resigned but its understood that donald trump made the decision to remove him after a review from his chief of staff john kelly under the best of circumstanceswhen america has a president who is disciplined willing to hear harsh but necessary truths and loyal to those he truststhe post of attorney general is perhaps one of the most powerful job in washington according to loretta lynch loretta elizabeth lynch an american attorney who served as the 83rd attorney general of the united states appointed by president barack obama in 2015 to succeed eric holder loretta lynch a political giant who held that post for barack obama said under ideal conditions it is also the toughest job in government rosenstein the hapless establishment republican ousted as deputy attorney general on monday december 4 2017 lasted a smidgeon over few days after days of increasingly public concerns over the likelihood of muellers dismissal by trump and amidst trumps former nationalsecurity adviser michael flynn had pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal investigators about his conversations with former russian ambassador sergey kislyak during the presidential transition mr rosenstein is being replaced by neil gorsuch who was recently nominated by trump for a lifetime job on the us supreme court the reshuffle puts mr rosenstein out of his misery and confirms mr trumps fondness for surrounding himself with toughasnails generals who already fill several top jobs in his government it ends the fear of trump administration being damaged by flynns plea to muellers investigation team these are not anything like ideal circumstances for mr neil gorsuch new holder of the toughest job in government the exclerk for judge david b sentelle on the us court of appeals for the dc circuit from 1991 to 1992 and then for us supreme court justices byron white and anthony kennedy from 1993 to 1994 he currently was serving as an associate justice of the supreme court of the united states how long mr neil gorsuch lasts is anyones guess if he only emerges with his dignity intact and adhere to the orders and principles of trumps administration he will have done better than his predecessor president donald trumps interview with the new york times on wednesday stirred speculation he might consider firing special counsel robert mueller for investigating trumps business dealings as part of the russia probe but trump could not fire mueller directly according to the law that authorizes muellers probe firing the deputy attorney general simply means setting off a chainreaction that would throw the justice department into upheaval and consequently reaching his target to fire robert mueller under his dictatorship hed certainly begun by dismissing rosenstein whose political loyalties trump questioned in the times interview on wednesday in which he also warned mueller against broadening his investigation such a scenario would parallel president richard nixons 1973 saturday night massacre when nixon forced out the top two officials in the justice department in order to oust the watergate special counsel i dont think thats politically survivable and its not clear how much collateral damage he will do putting himself into a position to have somebody fire mueller said senator sheldon whitehouse a democrat from rhode island expanding investigation muellers investigation has expanded to examine a broad range of transactions involving the presidents businesses including dealings by his soninlaw jared kushner and commerce secretary wilbur ross a person familiar with the probe told bloomberg news trump told the times that if mueller examined his familys finances beyond any relationship with russia hed consider it a violation there is no possible way anybody at the white house could be seriously thinking about firing mueller said senate bob corker of tennessee a republican i dont even want to comment on that because thats so far out of bounds it couldnt possibly be a serious discussion undercutting mueller trump has indicated he would try to undercut muellers credibility in the new york times interview trump said mueller has many other conflicts that i havent said but i will at some point separately the washington post reported thursday night that trumps legal team was exploring ways to question mueller by building a case that he has conflicts of interest in overseeing the investigation the post also cited one unidentified person familiar with the effort as saying that trump has asked his advisers about his authority to grant pardons to aides family members or even himself

politifact304,1,part 1 of cnn democratic presidential debate editors note this is part one of the transcript for the democratic presidential debate sponsored by cnn and the congressional black caucus institute on january 21 2008 click here to connect to part two or part three sen hillary clinton sen barack obama and former sen john edwards answered questions from cnns wolf blitzer joe johns and suzanne malveaux in a debate sponsored by cnn and the congressional black caucus institute monday night hillary clinton left barack obama center and john edwards answer questions on monday night joe johns cnn senator clinton good evening the numberone issue for americans of both parties is the economy and today the news is simply not good markets around the world are in a tailspin because of fears of a us recession so far this year the dow has lost nearly 9 percent how much money would your stimulus plan put in the pockets of the average south carolinian sen hillary clinton well joe im glad you started with the economy because that is the numberone issue whats been happening in the markets whats been happening with the home mortgage crisis 100a barrel oil so many of the issues that are really at the kitchen tables of americans today and what theyre talking to me about we have to stimulate the economy i began calling for some kind of economic action plan back at the beginning of december i have a package of 110 billion 70 billion of that would go towards dealing with the mortgage crisis which unfortunately i dont think that president bush has really taken seriously enough i would have a moratorium on home foreclosures for 90 days to try to help families work it out so that they dont lose their homes were in danger of seeing millions of americans become basically you know homeless and losing the american dream i want to have an interest rate freeze for five years because these adjustablerate mortgages if they keep going up the problem will just get compounded and we need more transparency in the market then i think we need to give people about 650 if they qualify which will be millions of people to help pay their energy bills this winter you know there are so many people on fixed incomes and working people who are not going to be able to afford the spike in energy costs we need to make sure that we start jumpstarting the jobs in this country again thats why i want to put money into clean energy jobs greencollar jobs and also make sure we have a fund that will help communities deal with the consequences of the home foreclosure crisis and make sure the unemployment system is up to the task and then we will have money for rebates but lets make them the right rebates everything we know about president bushs plans would leave 50 million to 70 million americans out because a lot of our seniors on fixed incomes dont pay income taxes but that doesnt mean theyre immune from the energy costs and the health care costs and everything else thats going up around them and we have a huge number of working people who thankfully dont pay income tax they pay payroll tax they pay a lot of other taxes president bushs plan would do nothing to help them but thankfully weve got leaders of the congressional black caucus here who are going to make sure that we get the right kind of stimulus and thats what the democrats are going to support its imperative we do it its a part of economic justice which on dr kings holiday is part of his unfinished legacy wolf blitzer cnn all right senator obama applause sen barack obama well we do meet on the king holiday and i think its important to remember that in the march on washington where dr king always talks about or its always repeated the dream speech that is so famous that march was for jobs as well as justice and unfortunately we have not made the kind of progress that we need in having a balanced economy and george bush has made it worse george bush has consistently skewed our tax code to the wealthy he has squandered billions of dollars in a war that i believe should never have been authorized and should have never been waged applause we have not made the investments that are needed in our school system you travel around south carolina along the corridor of shame and youve got children who are going to schools that were built in the 1800s and they are not able to compete in an international economy so it is absolutely critical right now to give a stimulus to the economy and senator clinton mentioned tax rebates that wasnt the original focus of her plan i think recently she has caught up with what i had originally said which is weve got to get taxes into the tax cuts into the pockets of hardworking americans right away and it is important for us to make sure that they are not just going to the wealthy they should be going to folks who are making 75000 a year or less and they should be going to folks who only pay payroll tax but typically are not paying income tax if we do that then not only can we stimulate the economy those are the folks who are most likely to spend money right away blitzer do you agree with her 650 is a good number for a tax rebate obama well i think that we are going to have to get some immediate money what i do is i say for a typical family 500 for a tax rebate per family but also for senior citizens get a supplement to their social security check because they get that every month we know exactly how to do it and that would provide seniors all across the country right away some money to help pay for their heating bills and other expenses that theyve got right now blitzer correct me if im wrong senator edwards your plan does not call for a tax rebate does it former sen john edwards no thats exactly right can i start by saying how proud i am to be here tonight a debate sponsored by the congressional black caucus on dr kings holiday and particularly on this night when were honoring the legacy of dr king central to his work was the idea of fighting for real equality between the races fighting to end poverty in america his famous poor peoples campaign which he was engaged in at the time of his death fighting for garbage workers actually in memphis and the chasm between the rich and the poor in america is wide it is getting worse the rich are get richer and weve added five million people to the poverty rolls in just over the course of the last seven years which is blitzer but what about the stimulus package edwards heres what we should do thats why im getting to this what bush does is he leaves 50 million as hillary pointed out 50 million americans theyre lowincome americans and moderateincome americans they are completely left out of the stimulus package if were actually going to deal with the legacy of dr king if were going to deal with this issue of poverty and i have a comprehensive plan to do that it is the cause of my life to end poverty in this country we also have to include all americans in this stimulus plan now one difference between what i have proposed and what my two colleagues have proposed is i have done something that not only stimulates the economy but creates longterm benefits investment in green infrastructure which creates jobs instead of just getting money out in the short term this will actually create jobs over the long term create green infrastructure yes we need to do something about the mortgage crisis i want to mention one last thing there is one other issue that was mentioned in passing by the two of them which is the issue of jobs and there is a difference between myself and my colleagues on this issue of jobs because they both supported the peru trade deal my view is the peru trade deal was similar to nafta and this is crucial to the state of south carolina blitzer but edwards no no and crucial to the state of the south carolina and jobs in south carolina south carolina has been devastated by nafta and trade deals like nafta blitzer i just want to be precise what youre proposing are really longterm objectives in terms of a shortterm stimulus package you disagree with them on an immediate tax rebate edwards no no what im saying is if we do what we should do to green the economy if we change our unemployment insurance laws modernize them to make them available to more people to more americans if we in fact give help to the states which gets money straight into the economy and we deal with the mortgage crisis in a serious way with a home rescue fund to provide transitional financing for those people who are about to lose their homes all those things will stimulate the economy blitzer ill let both of you respond but let me let senator obama respond first applause obama let me just respond to a couple of things i think the idea of bringing jobs is important which is why thats central to my energy plan but wolf youre exactly right that is a longterm agenda that is not going to deal with the immediate crisis we have right now youve got the european markets dropped 5 percent the expectation is that the dow jones tomorrow may do the same we could be sliding into an extraordinary recession unless we stimulate the economy immediately thats point number one point number two on trade john is exactly right that you travel around south carolina and you see the textile mills that johns father worked in closed all over the region and it is absolutely true that nafta was a mistake i know that hillary on occasion has said just last year said this was a boon to the economy i think it has been devastating because our trade agreements did not have labor standards and environmental standards that would assure that workers in the us were getting a square deal but the only thing i want to differ on john is this whole notion of peru the peru trade deal had labor and environmental agreements in it peru is an economy the size of new hampshire over 90 percent of the goods coming from peru already come in under various free trade agreements and john you voted for permanent trade relations with china which i think anybody who looks at how we structure trade in this country would tell you has been the biggest beneficiary and the biggest problem that we have with respect to trade particularly because theyre still manipulating the currency blitzer ill let you respond but senator clinton i want to get back to the issue of an immediate stimulus for the economy clinton thats what i want to get back to blitzer because who knows what the markets are going to be like tomorrow and there are a lot of people out there who are suffering already but go ahead and respond clinton well i want to just clarify a couple of points my original plan was 70 billion in spending with a 40 billion contingency that was part of the original plan in order to have that money available for tax rebates i hope that we could do it through spending and heres why i dont want to necessarily open up the tax code while weve got republicans in the senate who are going to try to come back and open up making bushs tax cuts permanent applause i understand that thats a real risk so i was hoping to be able to do it through spending but the crisis has gotten too deep and what happened in the markets globally today is a huge wakeup call the president should convene the working group on financial markets he should ask the secretary of treasury to do this immediately i know that theres been talking going on but the presidents proposed stimulus package is not adequate it is too little too late and it doesnt give enough money to the people who are hardest hit by the increased costs in energy and everything else applause as a further point i do believe that the greencollar job piece of this is important thats why i have 5 billion to do it there are programs already oakland california mayor dellums is working to have a greencollar job program we could put hundreds and hundreds of young people to work right now putting solar panels in insulating homes that would give them jobs and it would move us more quickly to a green economy and i think that if you look at this from a jobs and justice a stimulation and longterm planning effort we need to lay down the markers now and thats why the congress under the leadership of a lot of the people who are chairs of committees and subcommittees who are here today are going to play a major role in this and weve got to hold the line against president bush with his illadvised approach to stimulating the economy blitzer all right were staying on topic were staying on this subject but i want to ask suzanne malveaux to ask a question and then all of you will be able to weigh edwards you have to give me a chance to respond to senator obama blitzer all right go ahead respond quickly and then suzanne edwards thank you well first of all what i have proposed for greencollar jobs will create jobs within 30 or so days so we will have an immediate impact on the economy and stimulate the economy second no one has to explain to me what these trade deals have done to south carolina to north carolina my father whos sitting right out there in the audience worked in the mills for 36 years and we have seen what these trade deals have done to people who have worked hard all their lives edwards and the problem with peru barack is you are leaving the enforcement of environmental and labor regulations in the hands of george bush i wouldnt trust george bush to enforce anything certainly no trade obligations applause blitzer all right ten seconds go ahead applause obama well the only point i would make is that in a years time itll be me whos enforcing them applause and so were going to make sure that the right thing is being done and john you tell an extraordinarily powerful story i mean you understand whats happened with respect to trade here and i think it is powerful when you talk about it but keep in mind i first moved to chicago to be a community organizer with churches who were trying to deal with the devastation of steel plants that had closed in that region and so i spent 35 years working alongside folks who had lost their jobs and i know what its like for families to have put their life and their heart and soul into a company building profits for shareholders and then suddenly they had the rug pulled out from under them not only have they lost their job theyve lost their health care theyve lost their pension benefits and it is absolutely critical for us to understand that nafta was an enormous problem the permanent trade relations with china without some of the enforcement mechanisms that were in there that you voted for was also a significant problem and weve got to all move forward as democrats to make sure that weve got trade deals that work for working people and not just for corporate profits blitzer all right suzanne malveaux go ahead applause suzanne malveaux cnn id like to followup with senator obama it was just a few days ago that senator clinton asserted that she was the strongest candidate when it comes to fiscal responsibility she says that the new programs that she proposes she essentially can pay for she says that you have failed in that regard in the tune of some 50 billion worth of new programs that you cannot account for how do you respond to that charge obama what she said wasnt true we account for every single dollar that we propose now this i think is one of the things thats happened during the course of this campaign that theres a set of assertions made by senator clinton as well as her husband that are not factually accurate and i think that part of what the people are looking for right now is somebody whos going to solve problems and not resort to the same typical politics that weve seen in washington applause that is something that i hear all across the country so when senator clinton says or president clinton says that i wasnt opposed to the war from the start or says its a fairytale that i opposed the war that is simply not true when senator clinton or president clinton asserts that i said that the republicans had had better economic policies since 1980 that is not the case now the viewers arent concerned with this kind of backand forth what theyre concerned about is whos actually going to help the get health care how are they going to get their kids applause going to college and thats the kind of campaign ive tried to run i think thats the kind of campaign we should all try to run applause clinton well i couldnt agree more but i do think that your record and what you say does matter and when it comes to applause a lot of the issues that are important in this race it is sometimes difficult to understand what senator obama has said because as soon as he is confronted on it he says thats not what he meant the facts are that he has said in the last week that he really liked the ideas of the republicans over the last 10 to 15 years and we can give you the exact quote now i personally think they had ideas but they were bad ideas they were bad ideas for america applause they were ideas like privatizing social security like moving back from a balanced budget and a surplus to deficit and debt and with respect to putting forth how one would pay for all of the programs that were proposing in this campaign i will be more than happy barack to get the information because we have searched for it you have a lot of money that you want to put into foreign aid a very worthy program there is no evidence from your web site from your speeches as to how you would pay for it now why is this important its important because i think elections are about the future but how do you determine what will happen in the future well you have to look to the record you have to look to what we say in campaigns and what we have done during our careers and i want to be just very explicit about this we are not neither my campaign nor anyone associated with it are in any way saying you did not oppose the war in iraq clinton you did you gave a great speech in 2002 opposing the war in iraq that was not what the point of our criticism was it was after having given that speech by the next year the speech was off your web site by the next year you were telling reporters that you agreed with president bush in his conduct of the war and by the next year when you were in the senate you were voting to fund the war time after time after time blitzer all right clinton so it was more about the distinction between words and action and i think that is a fair assessment for voters to make applause blitzer ok thank you senator senator were a little off topic i have to let senator obama respond then senator edwards whos going to come obama were off topic but blitzer but go ahead and respond and then i want to get back to this issue that were talking about fiscal responsibility but go ahead obama lets talk about it hillary i will be happy to provide you with the information about all all the spending that we do now lets talk about ronald reagan what you just repeated here today is clinton barack obama wait no hillary you just spoke clinton i did not say anything about ronald reagan obama you just spoke for two minutes clinton you said two things obama you just clinton you talked about admiring ronald reagan and you talked about the ideas obama hillary im sorry you just blitzer senator clinton i didnt talk about reagan obama hillary we just had the tape you just said that i complimented the republican ideas that is not true what i said and i will provide you with a quote what i said was is that ronald reagan was a transformative political figure because he was able to get democrats to vote against their economic interests to form a majority to push through their agenda an agenda that i objected to because while i was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shift overseas you were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at walmart applause obama i was fighting these fights i was fighting these fights so but i want to be clear so i want to be clear what i said had nothing to do with their policies i spent a lifetime fighting a lifetime against ronald reagans policies but what i did say is that we have to be thinking in the same transformative way about our democratic agenda weve got to appeal to independents and republicans in order to build a working majority to move an agenda forward that is what i said applause obama now you can dispute that but let me finish hillary you went on for two minutes let me finish the irony of this is that you provided much more fulsome praise of ronald reagan in a book by tom brokaw thats being published right now as did as did bill clinton in the past so these are the kinds of political games that we are accustomed to clinton now wait a minute wolf wait a minute wait a minute just a minute blitzer senator edwards let them wrap up then im going to come to you yes clinton i just want i just to clarify i want to clarify the record wait a minute edwards theres a third person in this debate blitzer wait a minute senator edwards hold on there has been a specific charge leveled against hillary clinton so she can respond then ill bring in senator edwards clinton i just want to be sure obama go ahead and address what you said about blitzer we have got a long time to youll have a good opportunity clinton were just getting warmed up applause clinton now i just i just want to be clear about this in an editorial board with the reno newspaper you said two different things because i have read the transcript you talked about ronald reagan being a transformative political leader i did not mention his name obama your husband did clinton well im here hes not and obama ok well i cant tell who im running against sometimes applause clinton well you know i think we both have very passionate and committed spouses who stand up for us and im proud of that but you also talked about the republicans having ideas over the last 10 to 15 years obama i didnt say they were good ones clinton well you can read the context of it obama well i didnt say they were good ones clinton well it certainly obama all right wolf clinton it certainly came across in the way that it was presented as though the republicans had been standing up against the conventional wisdom with their ideas im just reacting to the fact yes they did have ideas and they were bad ideas obama i agree clinton bad for america and i was fighting against those ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor resco in his slum landlord business in inner city chicago applause obama no no no blitzer hold on one second hold on senator edwards senator edwards has been remarkably patient during this exchange and i want him i dont know if you want to get involved in this senator edwards edwards what i want to say first is are there three people in this debate not two applause edwards and i also want to know i also want to know on behalf of voters here in south carolina this kind of squabbling how many children is this going to get health care how many people are going to get an education from this how many kids are going to be able to go to college because of this edwards we have got to understand you know and i respect both of my fellow candidates but we have got to understand this is not about us personally it is about applause what we are trying to do for this country and what we believe in now fiscal responsibility which i think was the question it was a little hard to tell there at the end of that but i think the question was about fiscal responsibility i have proposed i think the most aggressive most progressive agenda of the three of us up here and i was the first to come out with a universal health care plan first to come out with a global warming plan first and to the best of my knowledge only at this point to come out with a comprehensive detailed plan to end poverty in america since we are on dr kings day this is the cause of my life everything i have proposed i have come up with a way to pay for it and ive been very explicit about how it should be paid for not abstract not rhetoric very very explicit but i do have to say in response to something senator clinton said just a minute ago both senator obama and i have said social security needs a solution and we have said we wont privatize we wont cut benefits we wont raise the retirement age same thing that hillary has said but she has proposed nothing about how were going to create revenue to keep social security alive and talked about fiscal responsibility heres the problem if you dont have this is not complicated the american people understand it if youve got more money going out than is coming in youre going to eventually run out of money and youve got to have a way to pay for it which is why now let me finish this lord knows you let them go on forever applause what im saying is we have to be consistent in what were saying i have said i think hillary doesnt want to talk about raising taxes lets just be honest about that barack and i have both said that youve got to do something about the cap on social security taxes which is now capped at 97000 it means if somebody is making 80000 a year every dime of their income is taxed for social security but if you are making 50 million a year only the first 97000 is taxed thats not right and people ought to be paying their social security taxes but the american people deserve to know what were going to do we can disagree theres nothing wrong with that so they can make an informed choice but they at least deserve to know where they stand and what wed do blitzer were staying on the economy but i want joe johns to ask another question so we can continue this dialogue johns all right well senator edwards lets dig a little deeper on the economic mess were in currently in 2006 a study from the center for responsible lending found that africanamericans are something like 30 percent more likely to be sold a subprime loan than white borrowers with similar credit histories and income the south carolina naacp said last month that the american dream for too many americans too many africanamericans is a national nightmare the national naacp has even filed a classaction lawsuit against 12 nationwide lenders so the bottomline question really is do you believe that lenders have specifically targeted africanamericans is this subprime mess really also an issue of race edwards yes is the answer i think they have targeted if they havent been racially motivated i dont know theres no way for me to know whats inside their head but what they have done is they have targeted the lowest income most vulnerable families and anybody whos paying any attention to whats going on in america today understands if you are african american in this country today you are likely to have a net worth of about 10 percent of what white families have this is not an accident i mean we can go put our heads against the wall and pretend that the past never happened pretend that we didnt live through decades of slavery followed by decades of segregation followed by decades of discrimination which is still going on today applause that history and that legacy has consequences and the consequence has been that africanamerican families are more vulnerable theyre more vulnerable to payday lenders theyre more vulnerable to predatory lenders which is why we desperately need a national law which i have proposed which would crack down on these predatory payday lenders its not enough to do it statebystate because these predators just move from place to place to place i was in a neighborhood in cleveland a few months ago oneblock radius 38 houses under foreclosure middleclass africanamerican neighborhood these people work they put everything they had into their homes and they were about to lose them because these predators have come into the neighborhood and taken everything they have so here are the solutions number one we need a national predatory lending law number two weve got to help lowincome families save edwards they have nothing to fall back on many have no bank account they dont deal with financial institutions we need to teach financial literacy we need to match what theyre able to save so that they actually have something that they can fall back on in case they get in a place where they need more money applause blitzer all right i want both senator clinton and senator obama to respond but briefly senator clinton your proposal calls for a five year moratorium on interest rates 90day moratorium on foreclosure five year keeping those interest rates the same alan greenspan suggested that we simply have to let this housing crisis exhaust itself trying to prevent the housing markets from going down merely prolongs the agony does your plan as he would seem to be suggesting prolong the agony clinton no i think it helps to mitigate the agony i mean what i hear as i go in and out of peoples homes and talk to so many who have already lost their homes theyre in foreclosure they see these interest rates that are about to go up and they know they cant pay them is that we take action now ive been calling for action since last march when i first started calling for it a lot of the same economists who now say dont do anything about it said well it wont be that bad well be able to weather the crisis well the fact is the mortgage crisis is not only destroying the dreams of americans for home ownership it is having a ripple effect across the world so my moratorium for 90 days is a workout its not a bailout i want people to be able to see whether they can stay in their homes paying a rate that is affordable for them and the interest rate freeze is i think merited because look at whats happening if youre a big bank that helped get us into this mess you go borrow money from abu dhabi or somewhere if youre a homeowner who has been at the bottom of this incredible scheme that was established youre left holding the bag and you dont have the house anymore blitzer thank you senator clinton so i just disagree with those who say dont try to do anything to help the people who need the help right now blitzer senator obama obama i think that we need to help them i think it is important to make sure that were not helping out the speculators but instead are helping out the homeowners who are actually living in their homes who have the capacity to make the payments if theyre not seeing a huge increase in their mortgage payments but understand this this is not new we have a history in this country of preying on lowincome peoples because they dont have access to banks the community reinvestment act is oftentimes not enforced as it should be weve got to open up bank branches weve got to give people access to financing so that theyre not going to a payday loan operation i two years ago introduced a provision that would eliminate predatory lending something that i had already helped to get passed at the state level but it is important for us to understand that weve got to give ordinary working people access to financing and its important to understand that part of the reason that they are borrowing on their homes theyre borrowing on credit cards is that the banks and financial institutions have dominated policy in washington and this is an area where ive got a policy disagreement with senator clinton when we talked a while back just in the last debate we talked about the bankruptcy bill which had been pushed by the banks and the financial institutions that said basically it will be harder for folks who have been lured into these teaser rates and then see their credit cards go up to 30 percent that they would have a tougher time getting out of bankruptcy in the last debate senator clinton said she voted for it but hoped that it wouldnt pass now i dont understand that approach to legislation i think it is important for us to stand up to these special interests consistently all the time and thats what ive done and thats what i will continue to blitzer im going to go to suzanne clinton wait wolf i have to answer this blitzer im going to go to suzanne malveaux in a second but i just want to give you a chance senator obama if you want to respond senator clinton made a serious allegation that you worked for a slumlord and i wonder if you want to respond obama im happy to respond heres what happened i was an associate at a law firm that represented a church group that had partnered with this individual to do a project and i did about five hours worth of work on this joint project thats what shes referring to now its fine for her to throw that out but the larger reason that i think this debate is important is because we do have to trust our leaders and what they say that is important because if we cant then were not going to be able to mobilize the american people behind bringing about changes in health care reform bringing about changes in how were going to put people back to work changing our trade laws and consistency matters truthfulness during campaigns makes a difference applause and thats what ive tried to do and i will continue to try to do as president of the united states clinton now let me start with the claim about the bankruptcy bill i said very clearly i regretted voting for it and i was happy that it didnt get into law by 2005 there was another run at a bankruptcy reform motivated by the credit card companies and the other big lenders i opposed that bill i said very forcefully i opposed that bill there was a particular amendment that i think is very telling it was an amendment to prohibit credit card companies from charging more than 30 percent interest senator obama voted for it i voted against it it was one of the biggest lobbyist victories on that very bad bill that the bankruptcy bill represented and i think its important you know if you look at the recent article about senator obamas work on health care reform in the illinois legislature its a very interesting piece about how he basically did the bidding of the insurance companies during that effort now im just saying that if were going to obama thats clinton be hurling these charges against one another im used to taking the incoming fire ive taken it for 16 years but when you get into this arena applause you cant expect to have a handsoff attitude about your record and it is perfectly fair to have comparisons and contrasts i voted against a 30 i voted for limiting to 30 percent what credit card companies could charge senator obama did not thats a fact crosstalk obama absolutely it is a fact because i thought 30 percent potentially was too high of a ceiling so we had had no hearings applause on that bill it had not gone through the banking committee i dont know about a lot of folks here most folks here if theyve got a credit card are paying 29 percent so under this provision that wouldve been fine and we had not created the kind of serious edwards you voted against it because the limit was too high is that what you just said obama that is exactly what i just said john because edwards so theres no limit at all obama there had been no discussions applause hold on john hold on listen to this there had been no discussion about how we were going to structure this and this was something that had not gone through the committee and we hadnt talked about it didnt make sense for us to cap interest rates clinton so you voted with the credit card companies obama no clinton thats the bottom line obama hillary i opposed that bill and you know i did applause clinton well obama and consistently did and unlike you and john who voted for it previously but heres the point what we have to do is weve got to have consistency in how we vote you cant say one thing during the campaign trail and then apologize afterward and say it was a mistake and that has repeatedly happened during the course of this campaign applause and i think that tells you the kind of president that folks are going to be clinton well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straightup debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern you in the now wait a minute in the illinois state legislature audience booing clinton just a minute in the illinois state senate senator obama voted 130 times present thats not yes thats not no thats maybe and on issue after issue that really were hard to explain or understand you know voted present on keeping sex shops away from schools voted present on limiting the rights of victims of sexual abuse voted present time and time again and anytime anyone raises that theres always some kind of explanation like you just heard about the 30 percent its just very difficult to get a straight answer and thats what we are probing for obama i feel bad for john blitzer i know applause obama because i know johns not getting a lot of time here let me just respond to this blitzer you can obama i feel pretty bad i do i feel pretty bad but lets just respond to the example that was just thrown out the bill with respect to privacy for victims of sexual abuse is a bill i had actually sponsored hillary i actually sponsored the bill it got through the senate applause that was on the back of 12 other provisions that i was able to pass in the state legislature nobody has worked harder than me in the illinois state legislature to make sure that victims of sexual abuse were dealt with partly because ive had family members who were victims of sexual abuse and ive got two daughters who i want to protect what happened on that particular provision was that after i had sponsored it and helped to get it passed it turned out that there was a legal provision in it that was problematic and needed to be fixed so that it wouldnt be struck down but when you comb my 4000 votes in illinois choose one applause try to present it in the worst possible light that does have to be answered that does have to be answered obama and as i said before the reason this makes a difference and i understand that most viewers want to know how am i going to get helped in terms of paying my health care how am i going to get help being able to go to college all those things are important but whats also important that people are not just willing to say anything to get elected and applause blitzer senator obama thats what i have tried to do in this campaign is try to maintain a certain credibility i dont mind having policy debates with senator clinton or senator edwards but what i dont enjoy is spending the week or two weeks or the last month having to answer to these kinds of criticisms that are not factually accurate applause obama and the press has looked at them they are not accurate and you need to present them as accurate blitzer were going to be coming back clinton well that law is still on the books it was never struck down that was there blitzer were going to be visiting all these subjects but i just want senator edwards to weigh in suzanne has got an excellent question coming up go ahead laughter edwards shes been wanting to ask it too can i just ask though before i do i mean i hear the back and forth on this one particular vote but it is i do think its important and i mentioned this about senator clinton earlier to be fair about social security i do think its important whether you are willing to take hard positions i mean the members of the congressional black caucus who are sitting in front of me right know they have to go to the floor of the house every day and vote on hard issues and they have to vote up or down or not show up to vote one of those three choices what i didnt hear was an explanation for why over 100 times you voted present instead of yes or no when you had a choice to vote up or down applause obama ill be happy to answer it because in illinois in illinois oftentimes you vote present in order to indicate that you had problems with a bill that otherwise you might be willing to vote for and oftentimes you would have a strategy that would help move the thing forward keep in mind john i voted for 4000 bills and if you want to know whether or not i worked on tough stuff i passed the first racial edwards i dont question whether you worked on tough stuff obama no no no hold on a second edwards i dont question whether you worked on tough stuff obama no no but you edwards the question is why would you over 100 times vote present i mean every one of us every one youve criticized hillary youve criticized me for our votes obama right edwards weve cast hundreds and hundreds of votes what youre criticizing her for by the way youve done to us which is you pick this vote and that vote out of the hundreds that weve cast applause obama no edwards and what all im saying is whats fair is fair you have every right to defend any vote you do obama right edwards and i respect your right to do that on any on any substantive issue it does not make sense to me and what if i had just not shown up obama john john illinois edwards wait wait wait wait let me finish obama hold on a second edwards what if i had just not shown up to vote on things that really mattered to this country it would have been safe for me politically it would have been the careful and cautious thing to do but i have a responsibility to take a position obama john you edwards even when it has political consequences for me applause consequences this most of these were technical problems with a piece of legislation that ended up getting modified but lets talk about taking on tough votes i mean i am somebody who led on reforming a death penalty system that was broken in illinois that nobody thought was good politics but was the right thing to do applause obama i opposed legislation that now is being used against me politically to make sure that juveniles were not put in the criminal justice system as adults even though it was not the smart thing to do politically it was not smart for me to oppose the war at the start of this war but i did so because it was the right thing to do applause obama so i understand that illinois has a different system than congress and that it is fine to try to use that politically but dont question john the fact that on issue after issue that is important to the american people i havent simply followed i have led email to a friend

gossipcop-9646723491,0,how ben affleck got big for batman v superman the first thing youll notice about the dark knight in batman v superman the second installation of the newly relaunched dc universe is that hes gotten bigger in stature muscle and armor the next hes also badder gruff aggressive and the kind of character willing to square up to the man of steel given this you might miss the third fact that batman or at least ben affleck the actor playing him is also well middleaged i knew that a big part of the audiences expectation around the role would be how i looked physically affleck now 43 tells mens journal over email and that was something i had some control over if i was going to fail in this role i wasnt going to let it be in a way that could have prevented if i had worked harder director zack snyder believes that he got the job done recently voicing his approval of afflecks portrayal as the iconic character in both of his personas hes an amazing bruce wayne lets just be frank about that and then when he puts the cowl on you know hes got the chin for it affleck accomplished the proper frame with help from longtime trainer walter norton jr of the institute of performance and fitness who he began training with through a mutual friend during his fitness preparation for 2010s the town based in boston norton makes almost weekly flights between his hometown and wherever affleck is whether its in los angeles or on location getting ready for this role meant working hard day in and day out with walter says affleck but it was the kind of work where i felt gains in not only my size but also my mental and physical health there are benefits of having history with a trainer seven years ago the body bounced back a little quicker says norton like any relationship its all about communication and honesty i can tell him a little something that he doesnt want to hear and thats fine were not tiptoeing around issues so we just addressed it right at the top we did what we needed to do to take care of him and protect his joints but that does not mean that affleck had it easy every week norton created a new regime for him with specific goals targeting each muscle group relentlessly and with that mentality they found themselves even overachieving their target numbers in context affleck weighed in at 198 pounds for the town and for batman v superman he went all the way to 231 at 77 percent body fat which they ended up dialing back to 225 this time around we did more bodybuilding we wanted him to be strong but we wanted to add mass the volume was higher we lived on a lot of the basics 80pound dumbbell curls heavyloaded carries and farmers walks with 60pound weights affleck needed that extra strength on set the batsuit weighs some 75 pounds there are also plenty of workout scenes making their way into the final cut showing off his ripped physique like one he shot in the batcave doing pullups while strapped to an additional 50 pounds in weight if i had to say there were any critical exercises that we always went back to it was pullups and chinups we wanted him to look like a thick mma heavyweight puncher explains norton this is a bruce wayne whos been lifting for 20 years hitting that heavyweight bag and working out every day in the manor ill just say that if you lined up all the batmans before ben and stood them next to each other theyre not 64 and they dont weigh 225 pounds hes in a whole other class heres a twoday glimpse at the workouts norton created for affleck as part of their twoyear training program you might not want to try this one on your own though i recommend that people find a trainer who they get along with create their own program suiting their own goals and if they approach it with the same enthusiasm that ben did

politifact396,1,hillary rodham clinton senator for new york floor speech of senator hillary rodham clinton on sj res 45 a resolution to authorize the use of united states armed forces against iraq as delivered today we are asked whether to give the president of the united states authority to use force in iraq should diplomatic efforts fail to dismantle saddam husseins chemical and biological weapons and his nuclear program i am honored to represent nearly 19 million new yorkers a thoughtful democracy of voices and opinions who make themselves heard on the great issues of our day especially this one many have contacted my office about this resolution both in support of and in opposition to it and i am grateful to all who have expressed an opinion i also greatly respect the differing opinions within this body the debate they engender will aid our search for a wise effective policy therefore on no account should dissent be discouraged or disparaged it is central to our freedom and to our progress for on more than one occasion history has proven our great dissenters to be right now i believe the facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not in doubt saddam hussein is a tyrant who has tortured and killed his own people even his own family members to maintain his iron grip on power he used chemical weapons on iraqi kurds and on iranians killing over 20 thousand people unfortunately during the 1980s while he engaged in such horrific activity he enjoyed the support of the american government because he had oil and was seen as a counterweight to the ayatollah khomeini in iran in 1991 saddam hussein invaded and occupied kuwait losing the support of the united states the first president bush assembled a global coalition including many arab states and threw saddam out after fortythree days of bombing and a hundred hours of ground operations the usled coalition then withdrew leaving the kurds and the shiites who had risen against saddam hussein at our urging to saddams revenge as a condition for ending the conflict the united nations imposed a number of requirements on iraq among them disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction stocks used to make such weapons and laboratories necessary to do the work saddam hussein agreed and an inspection system was set up to ensure compliance and though he repeatedly lied delayed and obstructed the inspections work the inspectors found and destroyed far more weapons of mass destruction capability than were destroyed in the gulf war including thousands of chemical weapons large volumes of chemical and biological stocks a number of missiles and warheads a major lab equipped to produce anthrax and other bioweapons as well as substantial nuclear facilities in 1998 saddam hussein pressured the united nations to lift the sanctions by threatening to stop all cooperation with the inspectors in an attempt to resolve the situation the un unwisely in my view agreed to put limits on inspections of designated sovereign sites including the socalled presidential palaces which in reality were huge compounds well suited to hold weapons labs stocks and records which saddam hussein was required by un resolution to turn over when saddam blocked the inspection process the inspectors left as a result president clinton with the british and others ordered an intensive fourday air assault operation desert fox on known and suspected weapons of mass destruction sites and other military targets in 1998 the united states also changed its underlying policy toward iraq from containment to regime change and began to examine options to effect such a change including support for iraqi opposition leaders within the country and abroad in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of september 11 2001 it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons should he succeed in that endeavor he could alter the political and security landscape of the middle east which as we know all too well affects american security now this much is undisputed the open questions are what should we do about it how when and with whom some people favor attacking saddam hussein now with any allies we can muster in the belief that one more round of weapons inspections would not produce the required disarmament and that deposing saddam would be a positive good for the iraqi people and would create the possibility of a secular democratic state in the middle east one which could perhaps move the entire region toward democratic reform this view has appeal to some because it would assure disarmament because it would right old wrongs after our abandonment of the shiites and kurds in 1991 and our support for saddam hussein in the 1980s when he was using chemical weapons and terrorizing his people and because it would give the iraqi people a chance to build a future in freedom however this course is fraught with danger we and our nato allies did not depose mr milosevic who was responsible for more than a quarter of a million people being killed in the 1990s instead by stopping his aggression in bosnia and kosovo and keeping on the tough sanctions we created the conditions in which his own people threw him out and led to his being in the dock being tried for war crimes as we speak if we were to attack iraq now alone or with few allies it would set a precedent that could come back to haunt us in recent days russia has talked of an invasion of georgia to attack chechen rebels india has mentioned the possibility of a preemptive strike on pakistan and what if china were to perceive a threat from taiwan so mr president for all its appeal a unilateral attack while it cannot be ruled out on the present facts is not a good option others argue that we should work through the united nations and should only resort to force if and when the united nations security council approves it this too has great appeal for different reasons the un deserves our support whenever possible we should work through it and strengthen it for it enables the world to share the risks and burdens of global security and when it acts it confers a legitimacy that increases the likelihood of longterm success the un can help lead the world into a new era of global cooperation and the united states should support that goal but there are problems with this approach as well the united nations is an organization that is still growing and maturing it often lacks the cohesion to enforce its own mandates and when security council members use the veto on occasion for reasons of narrowminded interests it cannot act in kosovo the russians did not approve nato military action because of political ethnic and religious ties to the serbs the united states therefore could not obtain a security council resolution in favor of the action necessary to stop the dislocation and ethnic cleansing of more than a million kosovar albanians however most of the world was with us because there was a genuine emergency with thousands dead and a million driven from their homes as soon as the americanled conflict was over russia joined the peacekeeping effort that is still underway in the case of iraq recent comments indicate that one or two security council members might never approve force against saddam hussein until he has actually used chemical biological or god forbid nuclear weapons so mr president the question is how do we do our best to both defuse the real threat that saddam hussein poses to his people to the region including israel to the united states to the world and at the same time work to maximize our international support and strengthen the united nations while there is no perfect approach to this thorny dilemma and while people of good faith and high intelligence can reach diametrically opposed conclusions i believe the best course is to go to the un for a strong resolution that scraps the 1998 restrictions on inspections and calls for complete unlimited inspections with cooperation expected and demanded from iraq i know that the administration wants more including an explicit authorization to use force but we may not be able to secure that now perhaps even later but if we get a clear requirement for unfettered inspections i believe the authority to use force to enforce that mandate is inherent in the original 1991 un resolution as president clinton recognized when he launched operation desert fox in 1998 if we get the resolution that president bush seeks and if saddam complies disarmament can proceed and the threat can be eliminated regime change will of course take longer but we must still work for it nurturing all reasonable forces of opposition if we get the resolution and saddam does not comply then we can attack him with far more support and legitimacy than we would have otherwise if we try and fail to get a resolution that simply but forcefully calls for saddams compliance with unlimited inspections those who oppose even that will be in an indefensible position and we will still have more support and legitimacy than if we insist now on a resolution that includes authorizing military action and other requirements giving some nations superficially legitimate reasons to oppose any security council action they will say we never wanted a resolution at all and that we only support the united nations when it does exactly what we want i believe international support and legitimacy are crucial after shots are fired and bombs are dropped not all consequences are predictable while the military outcome is not in doubt should we put troops on the ground there is still the matter of saddam husseins biological and chemical weapons today he has maximum incentive not to use them or give them away if he did either the world would demand his immediate removal once the battle is joined however with the outcome certain he will have maximum incentive to use weapons of mass destruction and to give what he cant use to terrorists who can torment us with them long after he is gone we cannot be paralyzed by this possibility but we would be foolish to ignore it and according to recent reports the cia agrees with this analysis a world united in sharing the risk at least would make this occurrence less likely and more bearable and would be far more likely to share with us the considerable burden of rebuilding a secure and peaceful postsaddam iraq president bushs speech in cincinnati and the changes in policy that have come forth since the administration began broaching this issue some weeks ago have made my vote easier even though the resolution before the senate is not as strong as i would like in requiring the diplomatic route first and placing highest priority on a simple clear requirement for unlimited inspections i will take the president at his word that he will try hard to pass a un resolution and will seek to avoid war if at all possible because bipartisan support for this resolution makes success in the united nations more likely and therefore war less likely and because a good faith effort by the united states even if it fails will bring more allies and legitimacy to our cause i have concluded after careful and serious consideration that a vote for the resolution best serves the security of our nation if we were to defeat this resolution or pass it with only a few democrats i am concerned that those who want to pretend this problem will go way with delay will oppose any un resolution calling for unrestricted inspections this is a very difficult vote this is probably the hardest decision i have ever had to make any vote that may lead to war should be hard but i cast it with conviction and perhaps my decision is influenced by my eight years of experience on the other end of pennsylvania avenue in the white house watching my husband deal with serious challenges to our nation i want this president or any future president to be in the strongest possible position to lead our country in the united nations or in war secondly i want to insure that saddam hussein makes no mistake about our national unity and for our support for the presidents efforts to wage americas war against terrorists and weapons of mass destruction and thirdly i want the men and women in our armed forces to know that if they should be called upon to act against iraq our country will stand resolutely behind them my vote is not however a vote for any new doctrine of preemption or for unilateralism or for the arrogance of american power or purpose all of which carry grave dangers for our nation for the rule of international law and for the peace and security of people throughout the world over eleven years have passed since the un called on saddam hussein to rid himself of weapons of mass destruction as a condition of returning to the world community time and time again he has frustrated and denied these conditions this matter cannot be left hanging forever with consequences we would all live to regret war can yet be avoided but our responsibility to global security and to the integrity of united nations resolutions protecting it cannot i urge the president to spare no effort to secure a clear unambiguous demand by the united nations for unlimited inspections and finally on another personal note i come to this decision from the perspective of a senator from new york who has seen all too closely the consequences of last years terrible attacks on our nation in balancing the risks of action versus inaction i think new yorkers who have gone through the fires of hell may be more attuned to the risk of not acting i know that i am so it is with conviction that i support this

critics indicating universal acclaim30 many critics singled out many cast members for the performances particularly paulson and vance313233 dan feinberg of the hollywood reporter praised the performances of paulson and vance writing as clarks discomfort grows paulsons collection of tics seem more and more human vances cochran is sometimes hilarious but he has a dynamic range such that hes occasionally introspective and always intelligent as well32 brian lowry of variety praised the casting of the smaller roles particularly connie britton as faye resnick and nathan lane as f lee bailey34 travolta and goodings respective portrayals of shapiro and simpson were met with mixed reviews by critics brian lowry of variety called travolta awful in the role adding yes shapiro spoke in stiff measured tones but the actors overly mannered line readings turn the attorney into a buffoon in sharp contrast to the more nuanced portrayals around him34 nicole jones of vanity fair called his performance campy and calculated35 dan feinberg of the hollywood reporter also criticized his performance calling it a mesmerizingly bad performance from the eyebrows down he also wrote that his unnecessary accent varies by episode and travoltas laser intensity feels arch and almost kabuki at times turning shapiro into a terrifying character from the next american horror story installment rather than a part of this ensemble32 maureen ryan of vanity fair conversely became more impressed with travolta as the season progressed i started in the realm of puzzled disbelief arrived at amusement and ultimately traveled to a place of sincere appreciation you simply cant take your eyes off travolta and that is a form of enchantment36 elisabeth garberpaul of rolling stone also called it arguably travoltas best performance since pulp fiction37 robert bianco of usa today wrote that travoltas was the shows broadest performance38 dave schilling of the guardian panned goodings performance writing his whiny gravely voice sounds absolutely nothing like the real o j simpsons deep commanding tones39 michael starr of new york post also was highly critical of goodings performance saying that he portrays simpson as a hollow sadsack cipher who speaks in a highpitched whine and sleepwalks in a fog he never shakes after being arrested for the brutal double murder of exwife nicole brown and ron goldman hes a forgettable annoying presence in what should be a showcase role for goodingwho to be fair is reciting lines written for him so he can only do so much with the material40 on the other hand joe mcgovern was more positive on goodings performance writing that his casting takes a risk and pulls it off41 elisabeth garberpaul of rolling stone described his performance as an unnervingly believable take on a potential psychopath with teetering sanity37 nick venable of cinema blend also opined that goodings turn as simpson could indeed get him on a shortlist of emmy nominees42 in spite of the mixed reviews for their performances gooding and travolta received emmy nominations travolta was also nominated as one of the producers of the show in the outstanding limited series category which he ultimately won goodings nomination was criticized by some reviewers43 reaction from individuals involved edit mark fuhrman who is portrayed by steven pasquale refused to watch the series and called his portrayal untruthful in an interview with new york post he said the last 20 years i have watched the facts dismissed by the media journalists and the public simply because it does not fit within the politically correct narrative at this late date fx is attempting to establish a historical artifact with this series without reaching out to any prosecution sources in a time when americans read less and less and investigative journalism is on vacation it is sad that this movie will be the historical word on this infamous trial after all it was based on a true story44 marcia clark praised the series and called sarah paulsons portrayal of her phenomenal45 during an interview on the wendy williams show clark admitted that she watched the series with friends to keep me from jumping off the balcony and that she was emotionally unable to watch the series recreation of fuhrmans testimony clark also said her sons were only able to watch the first episode46

cast members for what she saw as a lack of consultation with the families48 ron goldmans father fred goldman expressed numerous criticisms of the series even though they were portrayed sympathetically among them was his statement that the series did not devote enough material to his son who is only depicted on the show as a corpse he expressed concern that the generations of people who were too young to understand the events at the time would assume the series depiction of events was accurate goldmans family also criticized the series for not depicting the murders as they believe that goldman died trying to save brown from her attacker and that he was the man who eyewitnesses heard shouting that night49 goldmans sister kim criticized the series for sympathetic portrayals of simpson and kardashian despite the fact that in real life kardashian had admitted to having had actual doubts about simpsons innocence and eventually severed his ties with him50 ratings edit accolades edit

born hugh marston hefner in 1926 and grew up in a strict methodist family despite his familys conservatism his mother gave him a 1000 loan to publish playboy not because she believed in the venture he

which debuted in 1974 as playboy left the 1970s and the competition grew its sales began to decline it also suffered with the rise of the internet which made access to nude images both glamorous and grim easy for everyone in june 2009 the magazine cut its number of publications per year to just 11 while hefner sold his english manor house located next to the playboy mansion the same year for 18

advertisement life is too short to be living someone elses dream the extraordinary and debauched life of hugh hefner the original playboy who turned a love of movies sex and women into a global empire hugh hefner pictured in 2006 died on wednesday at the age of 91 he was eulogized by his only son as a media and cultural pioneer as his death at the age of 91 was announced late on wednesday it was an apt description for hugh hefner the pipesmoking hedonist playboy creator who revved up sexual revolution in the 1950s and built an empire out of the tried and tested notion that sex sells as much as anyone hefner helped slip sex out of the confines of plain brown wrappers and into mainstream conversation in 1953 a time when states could legally ban contraceptives when the word pregnant was not allowed on i love lucy hefner published the first issue of playboy featuring naked photos of marilyn monroe taken years earlier and an editorial promise of humor sophistication and spice the great depression and world war ii were over and america was ready to get undressed it was a wayward path for a middle class boy from chicago whose religious parents banned all talk of sex in their home hefner was born in chicago on april 9 1926 to devout methodist parents who he said never showed love in a physical or emotional way at a very early age i began questioning a lot of that religious foolishness about mans spirit and body being in conflict with god primarily with the spirit of man and the devil dwelling in the flesh hefner said in a playboy interview in 1974 part of the reason that i am who i am is my puritan roots run deep he told the ap in 2011 my folks are puritan my folks are prohibitionists there was no drinking in my home no discussion of sex and i think i saw the hurtful and hypocritical side of that from very early on hefner loved movies throughout his life calling them my other family he screened classic films and new releases at the mansion every week every year on his april 9 birthday hed run his favorite film casablanca and invite guests to dress in the fashions of the 1940s he was a playboy before playboy even during his first marriage when he enjoyed stag films strip poker and group sex his bunny obsession began with the figures that decorated a childhood blanket years later a reallife subspecies of rabbit on the endangered species list in the florida keys would be named for him sylvilagus palustris hefneri hefner grew up in chicago illinois in a prohibitionist household with two methodist parents who he said never showed affection towards one another he is pictured as a young boy some time in the late 1920s early 1930s when hefner was nine he began publishing a neighborhood newspaper which he sold for a penny a copy he spent much of his time writing and drawing cartoons and in middle school began reading esquire a magazine of sex and substance hefner wanted playboy to emulate he and playboy cofounder eldon sellers launched their magazine from hefners kitchen in chicago although the first issue was undated because hefner doubted there would be a second the magazine was supposed to be called stag party until an outdoor magazine named stag threatened legal action hefner recalled that he first reinvented himself in high school in chicago at 16 when he was rejected by a girl he had a crush on he began referring to himself as hef instead of hugh learned the jitterbug and began drawing a comic book a kind of autobiography that put myself center stage in a life i created for myself he said in a 2006 interview with the ap those comics evolved into a detailed scrapbook that hefner would keep throughout his life it spanned more than 2500 volumes in 2011 a guinness world record for a personal scrapbook collection it was probably just a way of creating a world of my own to share with my friends hefner said seated amid the archives of his life during a 2011 interview and in retrospect in thinking about it its not a whole lot diff in 1953 hefner published the first issue of playboy with marilyn monroe featured on its cover left by the 1960s playboy nightclubs had erupted in chicago and hefner was well and truly on his path to revolutionizing the way the country dealt with sex he is pictured right in the same year as playboys popularity grew so did hefners and his reputation as a ladies man found its beginnings hefner divorced his first wife mildred williams in 1959 after ten years of marriage they are seen left on their 1949 wedding day by the 1960s hefner was on his way to revolutionizing the way the country dealt with sex he had opened the first of his playboy nightclubs and was publishing the magazine regularly above he is pictured with bunny girl hostess bonnie j halpin at the playboy club in chicago in 1961 hefner is pictured with playmates in 1960 left and again in 1966 right the women became known as bunny girls he did it again in 1960 when he began hosting the tv show bought a fancy car started smoking a pipe and bought the first playboy mansion not long after it was launched playboy soon became forbidden fruit for teenagers and a bible for men with time and money primed for the magazines prescribed evenings of dimmed lights hard drinks soft jazz deep thoughts and deeper desires within a year circulation neared 200000 within five years it had topped 1 million by the 1970s the magazine had more than 7 million readers and had inspired such raunchier imitations as penthouse and hustler competition and the internet reduced circulation to less than 3 million by the 21st century and the number of issues published annually was cut from 12 to 11 in 2015 playboy ceased publishing images of naked women citing the proliferation of nudity on the internet but hefner and playboy remained brand names worldwide asked by the new york times in 1992 of what he was proudest hefner responded that i changed attitudes toward sex that nice people can live together now that i decontaminated the notion of premarital sex that gives me great satisfaction hefner bought the infamous beverly hills playboy mansion in the 1970s and began throwing his notorious raucous parties he is pictured outside it in 1975 hefners lifestyle expanded in extravagance along with the company he is pictured on the playboy jet in the 70s by the 1970s playboy had more than 7million readers and had inspired rivals including penthouse and hustler hefner is seen above in 1977 hefners profile as a global celebrity grew and he was seen more and more with one of his beautiful cover girls on his arm above he is pictured with shannon tweed in 1981 by the 70s hefner had already married and divorced his first wife and they had two children hefner ran playboy from his elaborate mansions first in chicago and then in los angeles and became the flamboyant symbol of the lifestyle he espoused for decades he was the pipesmoking silkpajamawearing center of a constant party with celebrities and playboy models by his own account hefner had sex with more than a thousand women including many pictured in his magazine one of rock n rolls most decadent tours the rolling stones shows of 1972 featured a stop at the hefner mansion throughout the 1960s hefner left chicago only a few times in the early 1970s he bought the second mansion in los angeles flying between his homes on a private dc9 dubbed the big bunny which boasted a giant playboy bunny emblazoned on the tail he continued to grow his empire throughout the 90s pictured in 1994 and watched as it welcomed generation after generation of women hefner was host of a television show playboy after dark and in 1960 opened a string of clubs around the world where waitresses wore revealing costumes with bunny ears and fluffy white bunny tails in the 21st century he was back on television in a cable reality show the girls next door with three livein girlfriends in the los angeles playboy mansion network television briefly embraced hefners empire in 2011 with the nbc drama the playboy club which failed to lure viewers and was canceled after three episodes censorship was inevitable starting in the 1950s when hefner successfully sued to prevent the us postal service from denying him secondclass mailing status playboy has been banned in china india saudi arabia and ireland and 7eleven stores for years did not sell the magazine stores that did offer playboy made sure to stock it on a higher shelf women were warned from the first issue if youre somebodys sister wife or motherinlaw the magazine declared and picked us up by mistake please pass us along to the man in your life and get back to ladies home companion playboy proved a scourge and a temptation drew barrymore farrah fawcett and linda evans are among those who have posed for the magazine several bunnies became celebrities too including singer deborah harry and model lauren hutton both of whom had fond memories of their time with playboy other bunnies had traumatic experiences with several alleging they had been raped by hefners close friend bill cosby who faced dozens of such allegations hefner issued a statement in late 2014 he would never tolerate this behavior but two years later former bunny chloe goins sued cosby and hefner for sexual battery gender violence and other charges over an alleged 2008 rape one bunny turned out to be a journalist feminist gloria steinem got hired in the early 1960s and turned her brief employment into an article for show magazine that described the clubs as pleasure havens for men only the bunnies steinem wrote tended to be poorly educated overworked and underpaid steinem regarded the magazine and clubs not as erotic but pornographic i think hefner himself wants to go down in history as a person of sophistication and glamour but the last person i would want to go down in history as is hugh hefner steinem later said women are the major beneficiaries of getting rid of the hypocritical old notions about sexhefner responded now some people are acting as if the sexual revolution was a male plot to get laid one of the unintended byproducts of the womens movement is the association of the erotic impulse with wanting to hurt somebody hefner added that he was a strong advocate of first amendment civil rights and reproductive rights and that the magazine contained far more than centerfolds playboy serialized ray bradburys fahrenheit 451 and later published fiction by john updike doris lessing and vladimir nabokov playboy also specialized in long and candid interviews from fidel castro and frank sinatra to marlon brando and thenpresidential candidate jimmy carter who confided that he had committed adultery in his heart john lennon spoke to playboy in 1980 not long before he was murdered with the dawn of the millennium came a new wave of women for hefner by then in his late 70s he adopted a more grandfatherly demeanor in silk smoking jackets and carried a pipe with him everywhere he is pictured with actress jenny mccarthy in 2001 hefners livein playmates holly madison bridget marquart and kendra wilkinson and their relationship with him became the focal point of a show called the girls of the playboy mansion in the early 2000s no signs of slowing down at his 82nd birthday in 2008 left hefner was presented a cake by a nude pamela anderson he is seen right smooching playmate at a recent party the line that people read playboy for the prose not the pictures was only partly a joke playboys clubs also influenced the culture giving early breaks to such entertainers as george carlin rich little mark russell dick gregory and redd foxx the last of the clubs closed in 1988 when hefner deemed them passe and too tame for the times by then hefner had built a 200 million company by expanding playboy to include international editions of the magazine casinos a cable network and a film production company before he married crystal harris when she was 24 in 2012 above together in 2014 hefner said he never found his soulmate in 2006 he got back into the club business with his playboy club at the palms casino in las vegas a new enterprise in london followed along with fresh response from womens groups who protested the opening with cries of eff off hef hefner liked to say he was untroubled by criticism but in 1985 he suffered a mild stroke that he blamed on the book the killing of the unicorn dorothy stratten 19601980 by filmmaker peter bogdanovich stratten was a playmate killed by her husband paul snider who then killed himself bogdanovich strattons boyfriend at the time wrote that hefner helped bring about her murder and was unable to deal with what he and his magazine do to women after the stroke hefner handed control of his empire to his feminist daughter christie although he owned 70 percent of playboy stock and continued to choose every months playmate and cover shot christie hefner continued as ceo until 2009 he also stopped using recreational drugs and tried less to always be the life of the party he tearfully noted in a 1992 new york times interview ive spent so much of my life looking for love in all the wrong places not surprisingly hefners marriage life was also a bit of a show in 1949 he married mildred williams with whom he had two children they divorced in 1958 in july 1989 hefner married kimberley conrad the 1989 playmate of the year who was then 27 the couple also had two children on the eve of his marriage hefner was asked if he would have a bachelor party ive had a bachelor party for 30 years he said why do i need one now they separated in 1998 but she continued living next door to the playboy mansion with their two sons the couple divorced in 2010 and he proposed in 2011 to 24yearold crystal harris a former playmate harris called off the wedding days before the ceremony but changed her mind and they married at the end of 2012 hefner leaves behind four children two of them are cooper hefner 26 one of his sons from his second marriage left with him in 2014 and christie hefner his daughter from his first marriage who is now 64 they are seen right in 2003 hefners public appearances diminished in recent years he is pictured in may 2016 looking noticeably more frail than in earlier photographs with playmate of the year eugena washington maybe i should be single he said a few months later but i do know that i need an ongoing romantic relationship in other words i am essentially a very romantic person and all i really was looking for quite frankly with the notion of marriage was continuity and something to let the girl know that i really cared he acknowledged at age 85 that i never really found my soulmate in 1974 in a succinct summary of his legacy he said well if we hadnt had the wright brothers there would still be airplanes if there hadnt been an edison there would still be electric lights and if there hadnt been a hefner wed still have sex but maybe we wouldnt be enjoying it as much so the world would be a little poorer come to think of it so would some of my relatives this is believed to be the last picture of hefner which is in circulation it was taken on june 16 this year fathers day and shared online by his son cooper he is pictured with cooper 26 and marston 27 playing back gammon hefner did not lead the sexual revolution he was a

revolutionary mindset he reinforced the subjugation of women at every turn to the point of literally locking them up huge metal gates at the playboy mansion 9pm curfew strict rules there was nothing revolutionary certainly nothing feminist about him he was just into a different style of patriarchy from 1950s puritans he published a lot of pictures of boobs and in doing so made a lot of money and

gossipcop-929375,1,the 100 boss breaks down season 5 finale why it was time to say goodbye to spoiler warning the following contains spoilers for the season 5 finale of the 100 read at your own risk well after multiple apocalypses nuclear wars and environmental disasters its finally time to leave the ravaged and barren trash planet once known as earth behind in the season 5 finale of the cws the 100 clarke eliza taylor bellamy bob morley and the survivors of the human race made it off the planet just in time to escape nuclear fallout but their plan to go to cryosleep and wake up when earth is habitable again failed and monty christopher larkin secretly charted a new course for his sleeping friends after figuring out the eligiuss real mission to find and settle on a different planet lightyears away nestled in a binary star system and so when clarke and bellamy wake they find themselves headed for a completely new home a home that may not be ready for them to call it home just yet below the 100 showrunner jason rothenberg discusses how the writers decided to move on from earth entirely where clarke bellamy and octavia marie avgeropoulos can go from here and what end of book one meant for the series entertainment weekly what inspired this ending to leap forward 125 years to lose monty and harper to introduce us to their son and to effectively start all over but with a new planet and two suns jason rothenberg there was a confluence of things we were trying to solve one of them was we didnt know whether it was going to be a season or a series finale so i needed the ending to be a satisfying piece of storytelling and at the same time tee up something that was really mysterious and enticing for the audience and to be honest with you for the powers that be at the network and studio thats part of the dance from an insidebaseball perspective but our narrative threads the spaceship with cryosleep on it that had come back from an interstellar mission the two armies fighting over this one valley naturally led us to this idea of going to explore another world it was in the dna of the 100 that when we say something bads gonna happen it happens so as i was breaking the season with the writers last year they were like we have to destroy the valley that just made the most logical sense right humans would squabble over something so pivotal that they end up destroying it was that what you were hoping people took away from this ending yeah i mean were all on this planet together and yet we dont care what were doing to the atmosphere one of the things we were trying to say and its a little bit of a nihilistic opinion of the human race is that man couldnt overcome their innate instincts to make war the last shot has a card saying end of book one weve never seen anything like that before what did you mean by that it also could have said end of planet one we have the opportunity to create a new world literally in this case and its a binary star system so were gonna play with what that means in an interesting way theres definitely life on that planet we can see that from space in the finale battlestar galactica is a huge influence of mine and so is interstellar and i was also really influenced by the movie annihilation which i thought was great its inspiring us the idea is we can really do anything because life takes endless forms and environmental threats can come from anywhere some of it is beautiful and some of it isnt just like on our planet interesting and what are you calling the planet i cant tell you thats a spoiler for next season but we are going in search of eligius iii with the hope that eligius iii made it to this planet and populated it and were able to survive well join what is essentially the next outpost for humanity the story for season 6 is in many ways about what happened to eligius iii and how we interact with what happened to eligius iii are there survivors what are the threats in the woods are there woods here are there things that dont exist on earth you better believe there are were going to really lean into scifi worldbuilding with this planet diyah perathe cw sadly in order for the survivors to find this new planet monty and harper had to say goodbye how did actors christopher larkin and chelsey reist react to leaving their characters behind its always hard to write a character thats beloved off a show and in this case two of them chris and i had big long conversations about it before we started i have sitdowns with all the series regulars at the start of the season but chelsey who wasnt a series regular but was certainly a huge part of our shows family when i finally figured out what the ending was going to be i called her she was on her way to work and i remember she kind of knew what the call was about they all know when that call comes in its not like we talk on the phone very often and she had to pull over she was sad and it was a hard conversation but then i pitched her what it was and i sensed a shift in her on that call like she realized how potentially powerful and emotional and beautiful it would be giving these two people a happilyeverafter which is not something the show traffics in you know and once we started doing it it was the most emotional day ive ever experienced on set i think it was for everybody involved its a shock for bellamy and clarke certainly but at least theyve reconciled what is their dynamic going to be like going forward in a way they now have madi and jordan to take care of as like their kids laughs thats a funny way to think about that jordan is a child in many ways even though biologically hes as old as they are but hes experienced nothing madis far more developed emotionally and bellamy and clarke have always been the center of the show and their relationship is so important to everything we do when theyre in alignment and have the same goal things work out when theyre on opposite sides its usually a sshow laughs so right now theyre back to being in alignment but a lot of other characters are not going to forgive clarke as readily as bellamy has and that is something were going to keep an eye on as season 6 begins but they will go forward with montys wish for them to do better theyll be committed to that course clarke i think even more strongly than bellamy going forward what makes their relationship so unique at this point in the series at the moment theyre in their development as people they are partners and sometimes i say theyre best friends theyre certainly not romantic yet i think personally that that is unique and rare and different than what you normally see in oppositesex leading roles in television shows you know and obviously a lot of people in our fandom still ask that question and yearn for that and i get that and appreciate that and love that they watch the show but i cant make any promises one way or another where they are right now is my favorite place for them to be which is nonromantic partners and soulmates aligned going in the same direction diyah perathe cw bellamy and octavia though still have a ways to go what kept you from giving them a scene where they completely patched things up i feel like that relationship took a while to break and its going to take a while for it to recover octavia has not yet really reconciled with what shes done she was going to sacrifice herself for them and she got that taken away from her on some level were going to play with this a lot in season 6 shes kind of pissed off and still bitter that people dont accept that she did keep them alive that she took on all of that misery so the people in the bunker wouldnt break to me shes going to need to come out of that on the other side before bellamy can fully accept her also part of bellamys journey is that his sister was always his touchstone no matter what he did we were going to forgive him because it was for her for the sister he loved and we loved he needs to move on from that too thats not owning your own life so he needs to figure out who he is independent of that the two of them need to come back together and have a grownup relationship hes lived as her father his whole life but hes her brother and shes her own person too thats where the journey begins for them next season now just to clarify is mccreary dead clarke squashed his melon but that said you didnt see a body at the end so i suppose the door is open uh oh what about kane hes in a medically induced coma and actor henry ian cusick is on a new series should we brace ourselves for an exit i think its too early to say for sure hes in the 100 next season as we begin the journey and i love him as an actor and what hes brought to the show hell always be a core member of the 100 family and were going to figure out his schedule what about diyoza and her baby her fetus is now what the oldest fetus in the world its 200 years old laughs two hundred years old and five months and yes everybody whos alive at the end of season 5 is in season 6 fianlly with the end of book one card and this reset in mind how long do you see the 100 going on for the truth is that i used to have an ending in mind but we passed that ending a while ago and yet the show keeps staying for me creatively challenging and exciting as long as it is that for me i will stay on this show and the show will stay on the air given the cw boss mark pedowitzs desires for me shows should have an ending and they should not go on forever and when you start repeating yourself too much then thats time to walk away but at this point thats one of the reasons we put end of book one on that screen because it really is the end of one adventure and the beginning of another

zayn malik says gigi hadid is the most amazing woman i have ever met as he defends her against twitter trolls following a tweet from him which many assumed was about her lets rewind for a second so gigi was spotted out with her friend samuel krost and many paparazzi agencies immediately referred to him as her mystery man gigi then took to twitter to shut down any romance rumours writing if you outlets are going to continue writing bs headlines every time im seen with a friend of the male gender then theres going to be a lot of unneeded confusion sic later zayn tweeted to any dumb f out there that wants to make their own stories up which many assumed was fighting gigis corner about the photos the singer later took to twitter again though to not only deny his original tweet was about his exgirlfriend but to shut down any trolls who were attacking the model on social media he wrote my tweet was not about gigihadid so leave her the f alone she is the most amazing woman ive ever known and does nothing but love and support me when lord knows i dont deserve it so if you have anything to say me and ill put you the f straight if you know nothing shut your fucking mouth were as

gossipcop-871519,1,edie falco lays down the law in law order true crime the menendez murders in 1989 edie falco paid little attention to the sensational murder case dominating the headlines involving the wealthy menendez family the case was in the background of my life says falco when asked about the national fascination with the brutal beverly hills living room slayings of entertainment executive jose menendez and his wife mary louise kitty menendez the suspects were their sons lyle and erik who were 21 and 18 respectively at the time of the murders there were other things to think about and there were not 7000 channels at the time says the brooklyn native her distracted impression was that it was just a couple of bratty kids that killed their rich parents advertisement a few years shy of the crimes 30th anniversary the case has moved to the frontline of falcos character gallery as the acclaimed actress who scored backtoback triumphs with her emmywinning roles on the sopranos and nurse jackie stars in nbcs law order true crime the menendez murders premiering sept 26 falco plays nononsense defense attorney leslie abramson in the eightepisode series which introduces a nonfiction extension to the brand created by dick wolf the producer hopes the project is the first of many that can use the lo formula to reexamine highprofile crimes such as the hillside strangler and son of sam there are so many of these cases i want to know a lot more about wolf said the menendez series will feature some law order hallmarks the colorful opening logo and the chung chung between scenes advertisement you have to appeal to your base wolf said with a chuckle im using every comfort zone for my audience the docudrama also marks the latest in a stream of hollywood projects that reflect the ongoing interest in the scandalous murders which centered on whether the menendez brothers were coldblooded murderers or victims of horrific child abuse who killed their parents to escape torment the brothers were sentenced to life in prison in 1996 among the various menendez projects were lifetimes june film menendez blood brothers which featured courtney love as kitty menendez and two separate madefortv movies in 1994 advertisement the law order version is the first to position abramson as the central character and it plans to offer a more extensive examination of the killings executive producer and showrunner rene balcer believes the brothers were unfairly treated by what he called a corrupt justice system these guys never should have been sentenced to life without parole balcer said they were overcharged and oversentenced they were abused kids who killed their abusers although she had little interest at the time falco said she was attracted to the series by the complicated dynamics things are never what they seem the actress said on location in pasadena just minutes earlier she had put on the wig that matched abramsons famously frizzy mane her appearance was worlds away from that of manicured mob wife carmela soprano or bleary drugaddicted nurse jackie peyton portrait of edie falco in pasadena ca july 24 2017 francine orr los angeles times advertisement full coverage fall 2017 tv preview its a story of child abuse that stuff hopefully affects everyone but it really just gets me right in my gut what these boys were put through said falco the mother of two young kids theres something more grotesque about the fact that they had money they were not allowed to be seen as victims people were not receptive to hearing how hard it was for them she was also moved by abramsons mission to do right by the brothers leslie is a woman who is very good at her job she said she is passionate about it and believes in her clients that doesnt necessarily mean she believes theyre innocent but she believes in their right to a fair defense thats commendable of her i think she really cared about these guys beyond working for them moments later falco was on the steps of an office building substituting for the beverly hills courthouse surrounded by extras playing reporters at a brief news conference her tone was direct and stern as she channeled abramson accusing prosecutors and police of violating her clients rights of doctorpatient privilege by seizing notes from erik menendezs psychiatrist any of us that sees a doctor consults a lawyer or even confides in a priest minister or rabbi had better be worried she said as abramson although falco captures the attorneys toughasnails demeanor she got no advice from her reallife counterpart i did not meet her says falco i dont think she has any interest in being involved with this that was the word i got but theres plenty to see of her on youtube and in photos she also wrote a great book called the defense is ready which said a great deal about who she is and about the justice system especially at that time advertisement lesli linka glatter homeland who directed the first two episodes and also serves as an executive producer said she was continually impressed by falcos performance edie is an amazing actress and she cannot lie said glatter when she takes on a role she gets fully inside a character taking on such an intense character in a broadcast network drama was not part of a specific career plan said falco i have never known my creative direction after two iconic roles she said for a long time after the sopranos the offers were all italian wives after nurse jackie it was tons of scripts about drug addicts reflecting on those roles gives her both personal and professional perspective the only thing that comes to mind is gratitude she says i feel tremendously blessed that i was presented with these two things that kept me busy for 10 years each it kept me working and

gossipcop-828460,1,2017 grammy awards the best worst and weirdest moments james corden hosted the 2017 grammy awards on sunday in an evening filled with some touching tributes some unusual acceptance speeches and a whole lot of blue ivy from beyonces unbelievable and hypnotic performance to adeles nonstop run of emotional wins to lady gaga crowd surfing for some reason heres a look at the best worst and downright weirdest moments from musics biggest night watch james corden opens grammys 2017 by tripping down the stairs dissing donald trump in epic rap best moments adele opens the show with her ring after her previous glitchy performance at the grammys adele returned to the stage to open this years show and her flawless delivery of hello had people in tears however many watching at home were just as obsessed with the sparkling band on her ring finger adding fuel to the rumors that she secretly got engaged to or even married her boyfriend simon konecki but we were mostly fascinated about how well she hit her high notes twenty one pilots strip down to their underwear corden responds when tyler joseph and josh dun won best pop duogroup the two artists stripped off their tuxedo pants and accepted the award in their skivvies while the stunt seemed silly at first it turned out there was a meaningful reason behind it all joseph recounted how years before they were able to make any money playing music he invited dun over to his house to watch the grammys and as we were watching we noticed that every single one of us was in our underwear josh turned to me and we were no one at the time and he said if we ever win a grammy we should receive it just like this so not only is this amazing but i want everyone watching at home to know that you could be next anyone from anywhere can do anything beyonces psychedelic liveholographic performance the lemonade singer who is pregnant with twins delivered one of the highlight performances of the night that ended up being more like art than your standard live grammys fare combining holograms and prerecorded packages with a live stage presence the trippy golden goddess experiment was unlike anything weve seen from her or the awards show in the past watch busta rhymes calls donald trump president agent orange in powerful a tribe called quest performance katy perry gets political perry delivered the debut live performance of her new single chained to the rhythm along with collaborator skip marley while the song would have been fun to watch on its own merit perry made sure to inject some bold political commentary aside from rocking a persist arm band and a planned parenthood pin on her lapel the duo ended the song by standing in front of a massive projection of the preamble to the constitution bruno mars channels prince in a tribute to the late star mars proved his love for princes legacy with an amazing rendition of the legends 1984 single lets go crazy while decked out just like music icon rocking a glittery purple suit complete with a white ascot mars showed just how talented he really is while covering the iconic song not only did he nail princes vocal range he shredded on the guitar in a performance that blew most other prince tributes out of the water photos 2017 grammy winners see the stars with their awards best moment of the night adele wins album of the year tries to give it to beyonce to say adele had a big night would be a laughable understatement she opened the show she performed the tribute to george michael and she became the only artist to win song of the year record of the year and album of the year at the same show twice her tearful acceptance speech for album of the year was a nonstop highlight reel for example she seemingly confirmed that she had indeed tied the knot with her longtime boyfriend while opening up about being a mom when she referred to simon konecki as her husband however her best moment might have come when she openly wept and said that while she appreciated the honor she felt wrong winning it over beyonce i cant possibly accept this award im very humbled and very grateful and gracious but the artist of my life is beyonce adele said through tears as beyonce looked up at her from the audience the lemonade album is just so monumental and so well thought out and so beautiful we all got to see another side to you that you dont always let us see and we appreciate that all us artists here appreciate you i love you adele said i always have and i always will watch adele apologizes for dropping fbomb during george michael tribute at the grammys worst moments metallica and lady gaga lady gaga got in touch with her heavy metal side during a performance with metallica and the results were awkward from outofplace crowd surfing to lead singer james hetfields mic getting accidentally turned off the whole thing just fell apart on its feet in slow motion adele makes herself cry we never like to see adele sad while she might have been flawless in her opening number when it came time to sing a tribute to the late george michael she had a bit of a vocal mishap that led to her getting very emotional while performing michaels 1996 song fastlove a clearly upset adele stopped the song and said i know its live tv i fked up i cant do it again like last year im sorry for swearing can we please start it again im sorry i cant mess this up for him after the second time around the singer appeared to be on the verge of tears despite a stirring performance and a lot of support from the audience greg kurstin gets cut off musical artists often have to contend with the wrap it up music when their acceptance speeches go long but rarely do you see their mics cut off entirely when adele and producer greg kurstin won the grammy for song of the year adele got to thank fans but when kurstin took the mic the show producers could not care less and cut away without letting him talk at all the move elicited a chorus of boos from the audience and was yet another tech hiccup luckily adele ended up correcting the shows mistake by letting kurstin talk first when they won record of the year james corden trolls fans over kanye wests boycott kanye west was very adamant about not showing up to the grammys this year so when corden came out to seemingly introduce a performance by the life of pablo artist a lot of fans and viewers freaked out then it turned out corden was trolling us entirely and the whole thing was just a setup to the invariably dry annual speech by recording academy president neil portnow it was a letdown to say the least news chance the rapper was everyones best friend at the 2017 grammys see the pics weirdest moments james cordens disastrous intro in what was supposed to be a joke mocking the recent spate of tech problems at various awards shows cordens introduction was filled with intentionally broken lifts pratfalls and various mishaps while it was very funny at the time it turned out to be a good predictor of the multitude of technical issues that plagued the rest of the show everything with john travolta the saturday night fever star came out to promote the fact that there was going to be a bee gees tribute later in the show while that alone was sort of weird what made things truly bizarre was his unexplained bling and his unprompted confession that he cant read without glasses this appearance will never make sense demi lovato singing bee gees tunes in a tribute to the iconic bee gees the confident singer wore a discotastic dress and sang stayin alive or more specifically only portions of the 70s classic while the tribute which also included tori kelly andra day and little big town on the whole wasnt bad it just felt a little disjointed overall see even more of the best and

window at the homes we pass i can almost hear what theyre talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed like millions of americans theyre asking questions as profound as they are ordinary questions they never thought they would have to ask should mom move in with us now that dad is gone fifty sixty seventy dollars to fill up the car winters coming how we gonna pay the heating bills another year and no raise did you hear the company may be cutting our health care now we owe more on the house than its worth how are we going to send the kids to college how are we gonna be able to retire thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the future john mccain will give us these are not isolated discussions among families down on their luck these are common stories among middleclass people who worked hard and played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays that promise is the bedrock of america it defines who we are as a people and now its in jeopardy i know it you know it but john mccain doesnt get it barack obama gets it like many of us barack worked his way up his is a great american story you know i believe the measure of a man isnt just the road hes traveled its the choices hes made along the way barack obama could have done anything after he graduated from college with all his talent and promise he could have written his ticket to wall street but thats not what he chose to do he chose to go to chicago the south side there he met men and women who had lost their jobs their neighborhood was devastated when the local steel plant closed their dreams deferred their dignity shattered their selfesteem gone and he made their lives the work of his life thats what you do when youve been raised by a single mom who worked went to school and raised two kids on her own thats how you come to believe to the very core of your being that work is more than a paycheck its dignity its respect its about whether you can look your children in the eye and say were going to be ok because barack made that choice 150000 more children and parents have health care in illinois he fought to make that happen and because barack made that choice working families in illinois pay less taxes and more people have moved from welfare to the dignity of work he got it done and when he came to washington i watched him hit the ground running leading the fight to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation he reached across party lines to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists and he moved congress and the president to give our wounded veterans the care and dignity they deserve you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it thats barack obama and thats what he will do for this country hell change it john mccain is my friend weve known each other for three decades weve traveled the world together its a friendship that goes beyond politics and the personal courage and heroism john demonstrated still amaze me but i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country for example john thinks that during the bush years weve made great progress economically i think its been abysmal and in the senate john sided with president bush 95 percent of the time give me a break when john mccain proposes 200 billion in new tax breaks for corporate america 1 billion alone for just eight of the largest companies but no relief for 100 million american families thats not change thats more of the same even today as oil companies post the biggest profits in historya half trillion dollars in the last five yearshe wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks but he voted time and again against incentives for renewable energy solar wind biofuels thats not change thats more of the same millions of jobs have left our shores yet john continues to support tax breaks for corporations that send them there thats not change thats more of the same he voted 19 times against raising the minimum wage for people who are struggling just to get to the next day thats not change thats more of the same and when he says he will continue to spend 10 billion a month in iraq when iraq is sitting on a surplus of nearly 80 billion thats not change thats more of the same the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver changethe change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change barack obama will reform our tax code hell cut taxes for 95 percent of the american people who draw a paycheck thats the change we need barack obama will transform our economy by making alternative energy a genuine national priority creating 5 million new jobs and finally freeing us from the grip of foreign oil thats the change we need barack obama knows that any country that out teaches us today will outcompete us tomorrow hell invest in the next generation of teachers hell make college more affordable thats the change we need barack obama will bring down health care costs by 2500 for the typical family and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all americans thats the change we need barack obama will put more cops on the streets put the security back in social security and never give up until we achieve equal pay for women thats the change we need as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history the bushmccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out for the last seven years this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century the emergence of russia china and india as great powers the spread of lethal weapons the shortage of secure supplies of energy food and water the challenge of climate change and the resurgence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front against terrorism in recent days weve once again seen the consequences of this neglect with russias challenge to the free and democratic country of georgia barack obama and i will end this neglect we will hold russia accountable for its actions and well help the people of georgia rebuild ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure america cannot afford four more years of this now despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy john mccain says barack obama isnt ready to protect our national security now let me ask you whose judgment should we trust should we trust john mccains judgment when he said only three years ago afghanistanwe dont read about it anymore because its succeeded or should we trust barack obama who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to afghanistan the fact is alqaida and the talibanthe people who actually attacked us on 911have regrouped in those mountains between afghanistan and pakistan and are plotting new attacks and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff echoed baracks call for more troops john mccain was wrong barack obama was right should we trust john mccains judgment when he rejected talking with iran and then asked what is there to talk about or barack obama who said we must talk and make it clear to iran that its conduct must change now after seven years of denial even the bush administration recognizes that we should talk to iran because thats the best way to advance our security again john mccain was wrong barack obama was right should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraqthat we must stay indefinitely or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right folks remember when the world used to trust us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as our president theyll look to us again theyll trust us again and well be able to lead again jill and i are truly honored to join barack and michelle on this journey when i look at their young childrenand when i look at my grandchildreni realize why im here im here for their future and i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workersthe folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures our greatest presidentsfrom abraham lincoln to franklin roosevelt to john kennedythey all challenged us to embrace change now its our responsibility to meet that challenge millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up our people are too good our debt to our parents and grandparents too great our obligation to our children is too sacred these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready im ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time may god bless america and protect our troops

politifact13310,1,at trump hotel site immigrant workers wary for weeks dozens of construction workers from latin america have streamed onto the site of the old post office pavilion in downtown washington and taken pride in their work building one of the citys newest luxury hotels but that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project billionaire developer donald trump put himself at the center of the nations debate over illegal immigration trump garnered headlines and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him when he launched his bid for the republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and rapists crossing the border each day into the united states from mexico but a trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the 200 million hotel which will sit five blocks from the white house on pennsylvania avenue according to several who work there a trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws but in light of trumps comments some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs since donald trump announced his presidential bid hes drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments here are some of the key moments video the washington post all of them said they have been talking about trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on june 16 advertisement its something ironic said ivan arellano 29 who is from mexico and obtained legal status through marriage he now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the trump international hotel the majority of us are hispanics many who came illegally arellano said in spanish and were all here working very hard to build a better life for our families interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the old post office pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the usmexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the washington region to build new lives several of the men who hail mostly from el salvador honduras and guatemala have earned us citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting central americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally advertisement most of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem said daniel gonzalez 45 a sheet metal worker from el salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his countrys civil war he became a us citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum he said he might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here gonzalez said of trump donald trump announces presidential run 23 the real estate mogul and reality tv celebrity announced he would seek the gop presidential nomination several of the laborers who travel to work from as far away as baltimore or manassas va every day fumed at trumps comments saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise usborn children do you think that when were hanging out there from the eighth floor that were raping or selling drugs ramon alvarez 48 a window worker from el salvador said during a break monday morning just outside the construction site were risking our lives and our health a lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic advertisement in response to questions from the washington post hope hicks a spokeswoman for the trump organization issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable us immigration laws when hiring the sites several hundred workers our contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law the emailed statement said lend lease the lead contractor at the site requires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal state and local laws the statement said michael d cohen executive vice president and legal counsel to trump said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a trump work site advertisement mr trump who is the 100 percent owner of the old post office hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor cohen said in a telephone interview that company is lend lease they then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them the obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to lend lease this of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees status is accurate a spokeswoman for lend lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project which is expected to be finished by early 2016 hicks also a spokeswoman for trumps political operation said the campaign had no comment on the matter trumps comments about illegal immigration which included a promise to build a great great wall on our southern border and bill mexico for the cost reflect deeprooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the united states yet concerns raised by workers at one of his companys real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country advertisement the rapid rejection of trumps comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is not just for trump but the entire republican presidential field trumps comments were popular with conservative activists across the country and may even have helped elevate his status with polls in the early nominating states iowa and new hampshire showing him gaining ground but they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the moguls remarks the nbc television network the macys department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with trump part of a backlash that has cheered democrats and caused worry among republicans seeking to win more latino votes advertisement on monday several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking dc chef jos andrs to dump trump by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at trumps hotel at the mammoth construction site in washington that bears trumps name workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114yearold building install airconditioning systems that will cool the new hotels 271 guest rooms or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows the site is a bustling microcosm of bluecollar work life in washington with soaring turrets

carting off piles of debris over the din of surrounding traffic foremen yell instructions to their charges urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom highend restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general advertisement arms covered in dust crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both english and spanish ahmad samadi 26 a site foreman who arrived last year from afghanistan under us political asylum said he has had to learn some spanish to communicate with his crew most of the workers here are migrants he said pausing samadi added about trump i dont think its right what he said theyre hard workers for david montoya 28 trumps comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a us citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country a truck driver at the hotel site montoya arrived from el salvador in 1997 gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001 every 18 months i have to get it renewed he said in perfect english adding that he dreams of permanent legal status advertisement montoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant which now includes three usborn children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of silver spring md he noted with pride that he thinks his story one of coming to a new world and of hard work paying off is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the

house20 in the first episode of season 10 my struggle 2016 scully is still working as a doctor for our lady of sorrows hospital now performing surgeries on children with severe birth defects she has

the series scullys catholic faith served as a cornerstone although a contradiction to her otherwise rigid skepticism of the paranormal25 due to her career in science and medicine she drifted from her catholic christian upbringing but remained somewhat entrenched in her religious beliefs scully almost always wears a gold cross necklace two conflicting stories exist of how scully received the necklace after scullys abduction in season two scullys mother told fox mulder she gave scully the necklace as a 15th birthday present11 in season five scully recalls receiving the necklace as a christmas present scullys sister melissa also receives a similar necklace on that occasion26 when she was abducted by duane barry a selfproclaimed alien abductee11 it was the only item left behind in barrys getaway car mulder wore it as a talisman of her until scully miraculously reappeared in a washington dc hospital27 after she recovered from the trauma of her abduction he returned the cross to her4 the abduction visibly tested the limits of her faith mulder believes that scully was taken aboard an alien spaceship and was subjected to tests because of scullys skepticism though she believes she was kidnapped by men not aliens and subjected to tests she believes she could have been brought there by barry and she began to exhibit symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder on a case involving a murdering fetishist named donnie pfaster28 this psychological revictimization continued after pfaster escaped from prison five years later and again attempted to kill her in her home ending only after she fatally shot him she struggled with what motivated her actions to kill pfaster and questioned whether it was god compelling her to kill him or something else29 sometime after her recovery from cancer scully began to regularly attend mass again at the request of father mccue scully got involved in a case concerning a paraplegic girl who was found dead in a kneeling position with her palms outstretched and eye sockets charred after scully discovered the girl was a quadruplet and two more were murdered father mccue shared with her the story of the seraphim and the nephilim which scully interpreted as a possible explanation for the deformations and deaths of the girls scully continued to have visions of emily and when the last girl died scully believed she was returning the girl to god upon her return to washington dc she went to confession to gain peace of mind and acceptance for emilys death30 in confession she regretted her decision of letting the girl go this suggests scully had doubts about her faith in the sixthseason episode milagro agent scullys vulnerability is exposed in this episode the murderer takes the victims heart out the suspect a writer named phillip padgett has a particular interest in scully and is fascinated by her beauty and personality when she goes to a church to observe a painting the writer is there and talks to her about the sacred heart of jesus during the conversation he says she visits the church because she likes art but not as place of worship scully doesnt say otherwise and later she says to agent mulder the writer told her her life story all this suggests that scully isnt a devout roman catholic although she attempted to approach again the catholic community and the catholic faith to which she was devout in her youth after handling the strange case presented in revelations and also after dealing with lifethreatening cancer during the fourth season relationships edit while in medical school scully carried on an affair with her married instructor dr daniel waterston who may have been the college boyfriend mentioned in trust no 1 in the show whether or not the relationship became sexual is never indicated according to anderson in the episodes audio commentary scully came very close to having an affair with the married waterston but left before she could break up his marriage the end of her relationship with waterston came about following her decision to go into the fbi31 after her entrance to the fbis academy at quantico scully began a yearlong relationship with her academy instructor jack willis with whom she shared a birthday5 towards the end of the series her previously platonic friendship with partner fox mulder developed into a romantic relationship when mulder was injured in a boat crash he awakened in a hospital and told scully that he loved her32 in the season six episode how the ghosts stole christmas a ghost that seems to know the inner workings of scullys mind suggests that her source of intimacy for mulder comes from her desire to always prove him wrong33 by the end of the sixth season mulder and scully were increasingly shown enjoying more lighthearted activities together such as practicing baseball34 using fbi funds for a night out during a movie premiere35 and watching a movie at mulders apartment36 in the season seven episode all things scully is shown getting dressed in mulders bathroom while mulder sleeps apparently naked in the bedroom31 in trust no 1 a man reveals to scully that he works for a new syndicate likeorganization and his job requires him and a few other colleagues to spy on her around the clock due to this he knows intimate details of scullys personal life right down to her natural hair color titian as later confirmed by chris carter37 it is suggested by this man that scully ultimately initiated a sexual relationship with mulder as he remarked that he was very surprised when she invited mulder into her bed38 the last scene of the series finale featured mulder and scully holding each other on a bed facing an uncertain future together in love39 in the film the xfiles i want to believe which takes place six years later mulder and scully are still in a relationship scully was concerned that mulders continuing pursuit of the unknown was taking its toll on their relationship and they could not be together if he could not escape the darkness however the film ends with the couple sharing a passionate kiss and in the secret ending after the majority of the credits a happilysmiling scully is seen in a small rowboat with mulder both clad in swimwear in a tropical sea having taken him up on his offer to run away together20 in the 10th season scully and mulder are no longer a couple as she chose to leave him21 at the end of

intimate again in the season 11 finale my struggle iv she reveals to mulder that she is pregnant with his child conceptual history edit anderson at the 2008 wondercon chris carter named scully after his favorite sportscaster vin scully of the los angeles dodgers40 john doggett was likewise named after vin scullys longtime broadcasting partner jerry doggett41 scullys character was also inspired by jodie fosters portrayal of clarice starling in the film the silence of the lambs42 the casting for scully caused a conflict between carter and the fox network carter had chosen 24yearold gillian anderson whom carter felt was perfect for the role43 of her audition carter said she came in and read the part with a seriousness and intensity that i knew the scully character had to have and i knew she was the right person for the part44 however fox executives had wanted a more glamorous bombshell for the part in a 2008 interview anderson stated that pamela anderson had actually been the networks first choice45 hoping that this would lead to the series involving a romantic element this led carter to insist that he did not want the roles of mulder and scully to become romantically involved43 carter decided scully would be the skeptic to play against established stereotypes typically on television the quality was attributed to a male44 because duchovny was much taller than anderson during scenes where mulder and scully stand or walk next to each other anderson stood on the gillyboard an apple box named after her46 scully appears in every episode of the 11season series with the exceptions of 3 zero sum unusual suspects and travelers she has appeared outside the xfiles on numerous occasions the most notable being in the millennium also created by chris carter episode

the lives of their young daughters thats a great feeling gillian anderson talking about the reaction to dana scully from female fans 47 anderson won many awards for her portrayal of special agent

nominations52 four golden globe nominations53 nine sag nominations54 and eight saturn nominations54 film critic scott mendelson writing in the huffington post cited scully as an example of strong female characters on television calling her one of the most iconic characters in the sciencefiction genre55 radio timess laura pledger also named her as a strong tv woman placing her at no 156 rebecca traister of saloncom opined that scully had a better character arc than mulder she wrote the very fact that her character was such a hard sell made her repeated brushes with the supernatural all the more powerful mulders desire to believe was so expansive his credulity so flexible that its not as though he was ever going to have either shaken from him but scullys surety was solid stable rigid every time she saw something she thought shed never see we saw it crack sparks fly from it she was forced to question herself grow change57 she praised her for being more rational resilient and mature than her partner and for their mature relationship57 in a review of irresistible emily vanderwerff of the av club wrote that it was a clich to put scully in danger as scully is the shows heart and any time shes in danger it feels like the show itself is about to be stabbed through the heart58 the character of scully has become something of a scifi heroine due to her intelligence and resilience

influenced in some aspects including temperance bones brennan of bones peggy carter of agent carter veronica mars of veronica mars olivia moore of izombie dr maura isles of rizzoli isles olivia benson of law and order svu joan watson of elementary sydney bristow of alias abbie mills of sleepy hollow zo washburne of firefly stella gibson another character portrayed by anderson of the fall and olivia dunham of fringe jade bastin wrote do all the characters scully has influenced live up to her definitely not gillian andersons performance and her chemistry with david duchovny arent exactly elements that can be replicated but these characters prove that scully isnt only the heart of the xfiles but also the character who had the most profound influence on popular culture66 indiewires liz shannon miller ranked scully as the no 1 most important character of the xfiles writing scullys legacy is so important in so many ways from giving us the gift of gillian andersons acting to inspiring an entire generation of young women to pursue careers in stem intelligent loyal flawed and brave scully was the shows beating heart and saving grace even in its lowest years as chris carter himself has said its scullys show67 the scully effect edit the character is believed by some to have initiated a phenomenon referred to as the scully effect as the characters role as a medical doctor and fbi special agent inspired many young women to pursue careers in science medicine engineering and law enforcement and as a result brought a perceptible increase in the number of women in those fields6869 at the 2013 san diego comiccon anderson noted that she has long been aware of the scully effect and stated we got a lot of letters all the time and i was told quite frequently by girls who were going into the medical world or the science world or the fbi world or other worlds that i reigned that they were pursuing those pursuits because of the character of scully and i said yay70 anne simon a biology professor and a science adviser for the series recalls i asked my intro bio class back then how many of them were influenced by the character of scully on the xfiles to go into science and half of the hands in the room went up thats huge that was saying that the show was really having an effect71 the scully effect remains a subject of academic inquiry72 references edit bibliography

through the emotional ringer josh neglected to invite drake to his wedding and drake called him out on twitter forcing fans to face the possibility that their fave tv brothers werent nearly as friendly irl but as it turns out the reason why drake lashed out against josh online was not because they werent friendly its because theyre like actual brothers and apparently josh was the worse for the wear in an interview with digital spy drake said i think it was a lot more toxic towards josh unfortunately he went on hes like man people were yelling at me on the street why didnt you invite drake to the wedding people were yelling at me on the street i was like dude im so sorry i didnt think it was going to be that big of a deal yikes i thought it was going to be some funny well guess you wont get invited to the wedding blah blah blah drake said but i did feel bad for josh because people really did attack him and im like bro this is a brotherly thing but drake said theyre all good now we talked about it and i was like dude im just a little bummed and he was like honestly first of all i didnt think youd wanna come secondly it was such a nightmare putting it all together and scheduling and invitations and then i just let my wife handle it all he said drake stopped by seventeencom hq to talk about his latest television gig competing as a celebrity on one of mtvs longestrunning game shows the challenge champs vs stars while he was here we had to get the deets on his brotherly beef with josh and see if the former costars are still on good terms its something you would have said to your brother if you werent in the public eye and have a bunch of fans drake told seventeencom about calling out josh on twitter for not getting an invite to his wedding i even texted him and said it i just wanted to make sure he got the message you know what i mean he asked laughing thats the only reason i went to social media with it because i did go to him personally and text him like yo bro what the hell im here weve been talking whats going on drake didnt get his invite due to a simple case of josh and his wife paige obrien being overwhelmed with all the planning that went into putting together a wedding of course it all just comes down to do you know what its like to plan a wedding ive got my wife saying this it costs this im tasting whether i want chicken or beef or lamb like i dont know i just want to get married so dont take it personally but there was just a certain number of people of course drake wasnt going to let josh off the hook that easily i was like what one piece of chicken one piece of chicken is gonna cost you that much more so we went back and forth and had our jokes and had our fun so is there pressure to be perfect friends with the entire world watching every single thing they do on social media drake doesnt think so ive known him since i was 12 or 13 years old so when youre going on 19 years of a relationship with someone its such a real and authentic and engrained relationship in my life that theres never really a point where im thinking we have to turn our relationship on for the cameras or weve gotta be perfect for the fans right now we kind of are just like real brothers drake even admitted that back in the day on the set of drake josh they had the same type of relationship there were some days i wouldnt want to talk to josh unless it was dialogue like unless it says i have to talk to you in the script i dont want to talk to you then there would be moments when we would finish a 13hour day where we were nonstop together and wed be walking to our cars and wed be like hey what are you doing right now just going back to my house play some video games okay cool see you in a minute so theres moments where were absolutely inseparable and we think every single thing that comes out of each others mouths is absolute genius and josh is the most brilliant person ive ever met then there are times i just wanna throw him through a wall its just like my little brother the old friends were able to put everything behind them they even filmed a hilarious vlog together to prove theyre still the best of friends were such a big part of each others lives like our history goes back before drake josh and before the amanda show i knew him before we even stepped in front of a camera together were always going to be brothers but even outside this whole facade of oh were brothers we really are good friends i love the guy it really does show our relationship that we might not speak for a month or two literally not talking me thinking oh my god he probably hates me but the second were in the same room and we lock eyes what happens the guy kisses me on the cheek we hug were like oh i missed you bro the second were in the same room everythings back to normal as good as drake and josh are at putting the drama aside for the sake of brotherhood the same cant be said for drakes competitors on the challenge champs vs stars drake got involved with the competition competing alongside other celebs like cardi bs sister hennessy carolina and lil mama to win money for the global down syndrome foundation but he soon learned the challenge isnt all about physical competition when you come into this experience just thinking i gotta get to the top of the jungle gym first and youre like okay cool lets go then realizing its a 24hour game and that most of the game happens outside of the physical challenges i had no idea there was such a psychological aspect to the game drake said i had no idea thered be undermining and people saying one thing and then going behind peoples backs to benefit them so that was pretty shocking drakes strategy to get as far as possible in the game be invisible well as invisible as possible when youre the star of every girl on sets favorite teenaged show the first thing one of drakes fellow competitors said to him on set was hug me brotha i just stayed quiet when the challenges came i just did my best to not be in the bottom three he shared then when we got into the room and all the people started yelling and screaming at each other and throwing people under the bus and outing people for this and that you know thats when i would just lean back take it all in and remove myself from that aspect of it so that was my strategy dont be a target so what can we expect next from drake hopefully a drake josh reboot right yeah actually if drake has anything to do with it at least one hundred percent i would do it tomorrow i would do it tonight i would do it right now drake said when we asked if he was down for a drake josh reboot im a freak about classic television and im so nostalgic and i grew up obsessing over classic television i feel like josh and i were able to do something maybe not equivalent but something that feels to me like i got to be part of a seinfeld or a golden girls a classic piece of television history drake even has some ideas on where the reboot could pick up theres so much story to be told for our characters like what happened did drake stay a loser and not go to college and try to become a rock star did josh stay his manager or did he go off to college theres so much story there and i feel like josh and i still have the chemistry where it can be fresh and new and funny i would love to be able to do that for our fans i would love to be able to have our fans be like what meghans an adult now and shes still evil she still destroying drake and joshs life but from her job in chicago all these crazy things i think fans would love ive had so many funny ideas i know that im 100 down to do it i know that dan schneider is 100 down to do it we just gotta convince jp okay josh the ball is in your court make it happen but in the meantime you can watch drake tell his funniest and most embarrassing life stories including his most memorable moments on the set of drake josh by clicking play above then catch drake on

of the quartet dying to be taken as seriously as the others47 following the films success afflecks career opportunities did not significantly improve at the same time his life became exposed to the public and parts of his life became part of pop culture and public life18 also in 1997 he had a small role in kevin smiths chasing amy starring his brother he returned to university for a semester before quitting to focus on his acting career39 afflecks career entered a dark period with a series of supporting roles in critical and commercial failures3633 he later remarked it dawned on me late that i should be selective about what i do37 in the independent comedy desert blue 1998 he starred opposite kate hudson as a smalltown jock48 peter stack of the san francisco chronicle felt that while interesting his character was entirely underdeveloped49 in 1999 he made an uncredited appearance in the teen comedy american pie50 and appeared as a punk rocker romantically involved with both gaby hoffmann and christina riccis characters in the new years eve ensemble comedy 200 cigarettes5152 in the comedy drowning mona 2000 starring danny devito affleck played a shy gardener suspected of murder53 elvis mitchell of the new york times acknowledged in an otherwise negative review that his role was well played54 also in 2000 affleck had a small role in the comedy attention shoppers and played fortinbras in ethan hawkes hamlet55 he appeared as the brother of heather grahams character in the romantic comedy committed 2000 with emanuel levy of variety praising a terrific performance56 also in 2001 he had a small role in american pie 2 and appeared in the teen slasher film soul survivors robert koehler of variety found him bland57 while carla meyer of the san francisco chronicle said that he did not make much of an impression but may have been too depressed to really act58 one positive experience affleck had during this period was working with van sant and cinematographer harris savides on finding forrester 2000 as van sants assistant and technical consultant can you imagine a better film school than that gus is not only somebody who i love a lot but is also who has taught me maybe more than anybody else in film3359 affleck found a degree of commercial success when he was cast in steven soderberghs heist comedy oceans eleven 2001 starring george clooney brad pitt and damon in roles soderbergh originally intended for luke wilson and owen wilson60 affleck and scott caan played mormon brothers and wisecracking mechanics who help to rob three las vegas casinos simultaneously61 while it was a great fun social experience affleck spent much of his time on set being like 100 feet away from the camera in the background36 he would later reprise his role in oceans twelve 2004 and oceans thirteen 2007 in 2002 affleck and damon starred in van sants experimental drama gerry playing two men who get lost while hiking in the desert6263 affleck damon and van sant conceived of the idea and wrote the screenplay together while living in neighboring new york apartments45 the film which had minimal dialogue received mixed reviews6465 affleck who rarely watches his own films61 said of gerry in 2016 that was an incredible experience i saw one scene recently out of context at the telluride film festival and i cant believe anyone ever sat through the whole thing it probably works better as a whole but one scene lifted out i thought this is unbearable37 also in 2002 affleck starred with damon and thengirlfriend summer phoenix in a west end stage production of kenneth lonergans this is our youth186667 lonergan and affleck became friends during rehearsals68 and affleck later acted in workshop productions of lonergans plays in new york6970 affleck in 2006 afflecks first leading role was in 2006s littleseen independent comedydrama lonesome jim directed by steve buscemi he played a depressed writer who returns from new york to live with his parents in indiana and begins a relationship with liv tylers character71 buscemi has said he knew affleck would be able to carry the film after watching his performance in gerry7273 stephen hunter of the washington post remarked afflecks interesting he probably cant be a star in big movies because his drawback is a voice that sounds like a snivel drawn through a wet nasal passage into a whine and yet in certain kinds of films this kind hes 100 percent authentic74 ty burr of the boston globe said affleck gets so far under the skin of this semicharming jerk that the performance becomes both brave and aggravating75 however stephen holden of the new york times felt it would be a stronger movie if mr affleck had the wherewithal to bare more of the passiveaggressive rage inside a more resourceful actor would have used this blank slate to scrawl a thousand telling details76 also in 2006 he had a supporting role in the romantic comedy the last kiss as a friend of zach braffs character77 20072012 breakthrough edit affleck had a breakthrough year in 2007 with the release of two films featuring critically acclaimed performances78 the first of these performances was in the western drama the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford in which he played robert ford to brad pitts jesse james79 affleck auditioned repeatedly for the role80 while the director andrew dominik had seen affleck in gerry8182 he cast him partly because of his beautifulsounding voice the voice is the thing that really gets you8384 manohla dargis of the new york times described afflecks performance as a revelation which manages to make the character seem dumb and the actor wily and smart85 similarly claudia puig of usa today declared him a real revelation who perfectly inhabits the role86 while todd mccarthy of variety said affleck made an indelible impression as the insecure physically unprepossessing weakling87 dana stevens of slate said the movie belongs to affleck who goes for broke in a wonderfully brave and weird performance as the craven naif bob somehow he makes us want to flee this creep at top speed even as we pray no harm will come to him for his performance affleck was nominated for the golden globe award screen actors guild award and academy award for best supporting actor while he was filming the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford in calgary affleck was visited by his brother who offered him the leading role in his directorial project the boston crime thriller gone baby gone 200737 while his brother was a firsttime director and in the midst of a career downturn affleck had confidence in the project i felt like i knew him better than anyone else did3788 his performance as an inexperienced private investigator tasked with finding a missing child earned affleck further plaudits for his acting89 manohla dargis of the new york times said im not sure exactly when casey affleck became such a good actor most actors want you to love them but he doesnt seem to know that or maybe he doesnt care90 jim ridley of the village voice described him as a major talent coming into his own91 while mick lasalle of the san francisco chronicle remarked that the revelation is casey affleck who heretofore has been a rather wormy uncharismatic screen presence92 ty burr of the boston globe commented id never stopped to consider casey affleck as a movie star before but under his big brothers tutelage he blooms as a leading man of richly watchable savvy and intelligence93 while the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford and gone baby gone were respectively a financial failure and a modest box office success8394 afflecks acting career was widely believed to be at a turning point33 however he lost career momentum while directing im still here 2010 a divisive mockumentary about the musical career of his friend and then brotherinlaw joaquin phoenix33 while affleck later clarified that it was a planned staged and scripted work of fiction95 there was much media speculation during filming about whether phoenixs public behavior was performance art or a genuine breakdown96 claudia puig of usa today remarked that whether truth or folly its not particularly well made even in the midst of phoenixs most oddball and obsessive torment its boring what exactly is the point of a joke that nobody really gets97 ty burr of the boston globe described it as an interesting but halfbaked exercise in persona deconstruction celebrity politics and metametaentertainment parts of it are close to genius most of it is actively torturous to watch98 kenneth turan of the los angeles times said the film turns out to be much more interesting to speculate about than to actually watch99 reflecting on the experience in 2016 affleck said we never thought people would actually think it was real in hindsight we should have had a press junket and done talk shows and said how it was a mockumentary70 affleck used his own money to fund im still here and after running out of cash95 filming was paused for a month to allow him to play a texan serial killer in michael winterbottoms crime drama the killer inside me 2010100 affleck later expressed regret over the films graphic violence70 philip french of the guardian found him disturbingly brilliant101 while peter travers of rolling stone praised a mesmeric implosively powerful performance102 mark olsen of the los angeles times said affleck showcases his uncanny ability to project a person holding two thoughts in his head at once as he often gives away nothing in his face to convey the firestorm obviously raging in his soul103 affleck then had a supporting role in the heist comedy tower heist 2011104 and voiced a character in the 2012 animation paranorman105 2013present wider recognition edit after spending a big chunk of time directing im still here and dealing with the subsequent backlash106 affleck returned to regular acting work in 2013 it was ugly for a minute i sort of remembered why i liked acting and i missed it59 in david lowerys aint them bodies saints 2013 affleck and rooney mara starred as outlaw lovers in 1970sera texas107 affleck was drawn to the opportunity to play a character who was a much better person than anyone thought after a string of roles as assassins or murderers or just creeps107 shannon m houston of paste described him as the films standout actor down to his very jawline affleck captures the physicality and feeling of a sincerely romantic outlaw108 betsy sharkey of the los angeles times remarked affleck plays conflicted souls so very well here you wish for a criminals redemption109 matt pais of the chicago tribune said he has great instincts when it comes to morally compromised antiheroes and without trolling for our sympathy afflecks bob is more than just a collection of behaviors its a smartly considered performance110 sebastian doggart of the guardian said he shows himself again to be a master of the criminal outsider111 while chuck wilson of the village voice found him flatout heartbreaking112 the opportunity to act opposite christian bale in the drama out of the furnace reinvigorated affleck and reminded him why he enjoyed acting113 claudia puig of usa today found his performance as an iraq war veteran dealing with posttraumatic stress disorder completely captivating the chemistry between bale and affleck is powerful intensifying the credibility of their brotherly bond114 matt pais of the chicago tribune said affleck finds something fierce and noble in uneven material and in his characters rage hes not like any other actor in american movies110 ann hornaday of the washington post described the performance as a searing portrayal of a young man who pushes himself to the punishing physical limit in search of both money and catharsis115 manohla dargis of the new york times remarked that affleck can come across as intensely vulnerable on screen which nicely works for a broken man like rodney116 in 2014 affleck and jessica chastain had supporting roles in christopher nolans science fiction film interstellar as the grownup children of matthew mcconaugheys character117 with todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter describing his character as thinly developed118 also in 2014 affleck and producer john powers middleton launched the production company the affleckmiddleton project119 affleck starred in three films in 2016 the first two of which underperformed financially120121 in john hillcoats crime thriller triple 9 affleck played an uncorruptible detective mick lasalle of the san francisco chronicle said he arrests our attention i wonder if any other screen actor has ever seemed so focused and so distracted at the same time he thinks more than he says and so we listen trying to get the part hes leaving out122 justin chang of variety described him as one of the most persuasive leading men of his generation123 while brogan morris of paste declared him maybe hollywoods best offbeat leading man few actors can suggest so much with such quiet precision and even here affleck is compulsively watchable despite his undercooked character124 in disneys disaster drama the finest hours affleck played a taciturn engineer on board a sinking ship david sims of the atlantic said he gives the kind of measured thoughtout performance hes so eminently capable of even if the film isnt complex enough to rise to his level he animates an introverted character with subtle mental busywork whenever hes on the screen125 sheri linden of the hollywood reporter noted that he manages to turn his man of few words into the movies most compelling figure126 affleck at the premiere of manchester by the sea in 2016 in his final role of 2016 affleck starred as lee chandler a griefstricken loner in kenneth lonergans drama manchester by the sea one of the films producers matt damon initially intended to star in the film when scheduling conflicts made this unfeasible damon

men and had previously offered notes on early drafts of the script61 the film was a box office success130 and afflecks performance received widespread critical praise ao scott of the new york times described it as one of the most fiercely disciplined screen performances in recent memory he conveys both lees inner avalanche of feeling and the numb decorum that holds it back131 kenneth turan of the los angeles times praised his quietly ferocious performance his willingness to submerge himself into this character to an almost frightening extent132 ann hornaday of the washington post said the film was anchored by a quietly volcanic central performance by casey affleck in a breathtaking breakout role hes long deserved133 david fear of rolling stone stated hes given impressive turns before but the way affleck gradually shows you the mans bonedeep grief and emotional damage makes you believe that one of this generations finest actors has simply been waiting to be coaxed out134 affleck won the national board of review critics choice golden globe bafta and academy award for his performance after dropping out of lowerys petes dragon in order to star in manchester by the sea61 affleck reteamed with the director to star opposite rooney mara in the experimental drama a ghost story which premiered at the sundance film festival in early 2017135 afflecks character dies suddenly at the outset and he spends much of the film covered by a white sheet with two eyeholes haunting his former home david rooney of the hollywood reporter said afflecks performance managed to resonate despite limited time onscreen136 peter debruge of variety said affleck has never been an easy actor to read hes a lowcharisma mumbler who tends to keep his characters emotions bottled up making him the rare performer who can convey as much with a sheet over his head as he does without137 jordan hoffman of the guardian described him as cinemas finest mumbler i cant even tell if hes speaking or just emitting highpitched vibrations anymore138 in 2018 affleck starred opposite robert redford in the outlaw drama the old man the gun his third collaboration with lowery139 in 2019 he directed wrote and

politifact104,1,us senator john mccain washington dc today us senator john mccain raz spoke on the floor of the united states senate about the marriage protection amendment the following is the text of his statement as prepared and submitted for the record mr president i believe that the institution of marriage can serve its public purposes only when it is understood as being a union between one man and one woman it is this understanding that offers public reinforcement to the vital and unique roles played by mothers and fathers in the raising of their children it is this understanding that offers a foundation for principled objections to those who would pursue the imprudent agenda of dismantling an institution that has served us well and replacing it with newer and more flexible understandings that are of questionable public value i also believe in the institution of republican government as described in the united states constitution this too is an institution that has served us well founded upon the precept that the american people speak through their elected representatives and these representatives remain at all times answerable and accountable to the people whom they serve today on the question of marriage we are told by advocates on both sides of the debate that these two institutions as they are currently understood cannot be reconciled and that one or the other must be changed i do not agree and thus i do not at this time support the proposed marriage protection amendment the proposed amendment would establish in our constitution a permanent resolution of a debate that is currently and properly being resolved in different ways in fifty different states by the peoples elected representatives our system of federalism is not easily separable from our commitment to republican government because it is driven by the idea that we are best governed when those who represent us live where we live and share the values that we share it is this understanding that has allowed us the strength as a nation to time and again preserve our unity and confront our challenges in times of crisis no matter how great our differences on issues that are the subject of heated public debate the continued vitality of americas commitment to federalism and republican government offers a hopeful example to strifetorn areas of our world where conflicts are tragically settled with bullets rather than ballots the constitutional value of federalism is doubly important in the area of family law because power to legislate in this area has traditionally been reserved to the states and because issues of family structure affect the fabric of the broader community creating the opportunity for approaches that reflect the values of the states that form our nation most americans believe as do i that the institution of marriage should be reserved for the union of a man and a woman wherever the question of samesex marriage has been put to the test of public approval it has been decisively rejected presently nineteen states protect in their constitutions traditional definitions of marriage in 2004 amendments to state constitutions preserving the institution of marriage exclusively as the union of a man and woman were placed on the ballot in thirteen states all thirteen passed by substantial margins thus far seven states have a constitutional amendment on the ballot this year there is little doubt they will all prevail proponents of an amendment to my states constitution which i support are working hard to collect the required number of signatures to secure a place on the november ballot if we succeed i am certain arizonans will adopt it overwhelmingly there can be little doubt that a sizeable majority of the american people whatever their views on other questions involving the rights of homosexuals in our society strongly support reserving the institution of marriage for the union of one man and one woman that majority includes i am confident majorities in every state in the union it includes americans of both political parties whose voting habits and general political philosophy range from conservative to moderate to liberal it is obvious that there is a broad consensus in this country in support of the traditional definition of marriage and mr president when the american people are so decided in a public debate their elected representatives will defend that consensus fortyfive states have either constitutional protections or statutes on the books defining marriage in traditional terms in 1996 congress passed and president clinton signed into law the defense of marriage act which allows each state to deny within its boundaries the status of marriage to the union of a samesex couple that may have been recognized in another state to date the defense of marriage act has not been successfully challenged in federal court the broad consensus in support of traditional marriage does not yet extend to support for the measure we are debating today an amendment to the federal constitution defining marriage as the union between a man and a woman i suspect that is because most americans are not yet convinced that their elected representatives or the judiciary are likely to expand decisively the definition of marriage to include samesex couples obviously the massachusetts supreme courts ruling in 2003 effectively extended lawful marriage to samesex couples even though it is apparent that a majority of massachusetts residents do not support that change in the interpretation of the states marriage laws but there are political remedies to what i believe can be fairly criticized as judicial activism that ignored the will of the people and denied a state government its long established right to regulate marriage in massachusetts more than 120000 voters signed a petition to place on the ballot an amendment to the commonwealths constitution restoring the traditional definition of marriage a constitutional convention to consider amending the massachusetts constitution is scheduled to convene on july 12th the nebraska decision is under review by the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit which has already heard oral arguments in the case and might issue a ruling as early as this summer most analysts on both sides of the debate believe the lower courts decision will be reversed and the exclusive protections for traditional marriage that the people of nebraska adopted in 2000 by a vote of 70 will be restored to their constitution nebraskas attorney general has not even felt it necessary to ask for a stay of the district courts decision pending the outcome of the appeal which would almost certainly have been granted i assume this is because nebraska still has a defense of marriage law on the books and there are no same sex marriage cases pending in nebraska courts or same sex marriage legislation pending in the nebraska legislature i understand that the precipitous massachusetts decision as well as the unlawful granting of marriage licenses to samesex couples in a few localities outside massachusetts challenges to traditional marriage laws in other states and the decision last year by the federal district court in nebraska that struck down an amendment to nebraskas constitution restricting marriage to a man and a woman have added to the support for a federal marriage amendment while that support does not mirror the broad national consensus in support of traditional marriage it is substantial and passionate i understand that and i respect it and i agree that marriage as a uniquely important institution should be protected but i do not agree that all the above circumstances have made it necessary to usurp from the states by means of an amendment to the federal constitution their traditional role in regulating marriage im reluctant to abandon the federalism that is part of the essence of conservative political thought in our country and i am very wary of the unintended consequences that might follow from making an exception to our federalist principles for the sake of addressing a threat to the institution of marriage that may still indeed seems likely to be defeated by means far less precedent setting than amending our nations constitution of course while i disagree that the current constitutional structure provides insufficient mechanisms for ensuring that the public meaning of marriage is not tampered with by activist judges it would be disingenuous to argue that those who support the proposed amendment have no grounds for their concern in recent decades there have been too many occasions on which the federal courts including the supreme court have forgotten their proper role and abandoned the virtues of federalism and republican government in favor of imposing their own policy preferences in the guise of constitutional interpretation decisions such as roe v wade continue to distort the democratic process in ways large and small to this very day it is a telling commentary on those who seek to change the longstanding public meaning of marriage that in many instances they have chosen to pursue their agenda through the courts rather than taking their case to the people those who wish to engage the issue in good faith should reject outofhand attempts to read into the constitution a right to samesex marriage because the constitution says absolutely nothing about it and because the longstanding traditions of american society have defined legal marriage as a union between one man and one woman indeed yet another reason i am reluctant to support the proposed amendment at this point in time is that i do not accept the proposition that the current constitution could ever reasonably be read to contain a supposed right that it plainly does not contain it is just not clear to me mr president that threats to the institution of marriage that have arisen in recent times have become a permanent breach of state authorities traditional role in regulating and defining marriage as the people of their states and their elected representatives see fit my confidence that the public meaning of marriage will be decided in the context of federalism and republican government rather than by judicial fiat is strengthened by the recent confirmations of chief justice roberts and justice alito and i hope that future appointments to the state and federal courts give us judges who share a similar understanding of the courts proper role in our constitutional system however if i am wrong and the nebraska decision were to be upheld on appeal or were other challenges to state marriage laws made and upheld or if majority sentiment and legislative remedies in affected states fail to overcome peremptory judicial intrusions into the political process of defining marriage or if the supreme court were to reject the defense of marriage act then and only then would the problem justify congress making the momentous decision to amend the most enduring and successful political compact in human history as the only recourse means to restore the publics right to define according to the values and concerns of our communities a critically important foundation of our society let me pose a hypothetical situation mr president to illustrate why we should be reluctant to impose a constitutional remedy to a problem that will probably be resolved in an ordinary state by state political process consistent with the respect for federalism we republicans have long claimed as one of our virtues those of us who consider ourselves prolife would welcome the supreme courts reversal of the roe v wade decision that found a constitutional right to an abortion the result of that reversal would be to return the regulation of abortion to the states where the values of local communities would be influential now further suppose that abortion rights advocates held majorities in both houses of congress and rather than argue state by state for liberal abortion laws they decided to usurp the states authority by means of a constitutional amendment protecting abortion wouldnt we who consider ourselves federalists loudly protest such a move wouldnt we all line up on the floor to quote mr madison from federalist paper 45 that the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs concern the lives liberties and properties of the people and the internal order improvement and prosperity of the state yes we would mr president yes we would mr president i believe that in the ordinary course of affairs the american peoples clear preference to retain intact the institution of marriage defined according to the values of our communities as the union of one man and one woman will prevail and that attempts to ignore the peoples will either by judicial fiat or by the occasional enterprising politician will in due course be overcome i might be wrong mr president and i respect the concerns of americans who believe current circumstances urgently require the constitutional protection of traditionally defined marriage but i do not believe that recent developments yet pose a threat to marriage that cannot be overcome by means short of a constitutional amendment while i will vote in opposition to this amendment i believe its advocates should be reassured that if in the future the public meaning of marriage is taken from the hands of the people and altered by judges who claim falsely to speak before all others for the peoples

walked up to mario batali to introduce herself as a chef she was excited to meet one of the most revered figures in the restaurant industry when they started talking she recalls she realized that hed been drinking and he became what she characterized as creepy just giving me this provocative icky feeling minutes into their conversation she recalls he told her come work for me ill pay you double what youre making moments later someone bumped her glass spilling wine all over her chest and down her scoopedneck shirt she alleges that batali began rubbing her breasts with his bare hands while saying something like let me help you with that as he groped her chest he just went to town and i was so shocked the chef says jaw on the ground i just stepped back from him in utter disgust and walked away the chef is one of four women who allege that batali touched them inappropriately in a pattern of behavior that appears to span at least two decades three of the women worked for batali in some capacity during their careers one former employee alleges that over the course of two years he repeatedly grabbed her from behind and held her tightly against his body another former employee alleges that he groped her and that in a separate incident he compelled her to straddle him another alleges that he grabbed her breasts at a party though she no longer worked for him at the time the woman whose allegations are described above has never worked for batali though she works in the restaurant industry batali was reprimanded for inappropriate behavior in the workplace as recently as two months ago according to a spokesperson for batali bastianich hospitality group the restaurantmanagement services company that provides support to around 24 restaurants owned by among others batali and joe bastianich in october 2017 a bb restaurant employee officially reported inappropriate behavior by batali to the company it was the first formal complaint about batali who was reprimanded and required to undergo training according to the company in a statement to eater batali said that he is stepping away from the daytoday operations of his businesses for an unspecified period of time abc where batali has cohosted the daytime show the chew since 2011 has also asked the chef to step away from the show while we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention a spokesperson said batali did not deny all the allegations saying that they match up with ways he has behaved i apologize to the people i have mistreated and hurt although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me much of the behavior described does in fact match up with ways i have acted that behavior was wrong and there are no excuses i take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain humiliation or discomfort i have caused to my peers employees customers friends and family i have work to do to try to regain the trust of those i have hurt and disappointed for this reason i am going to step away from daytoday operations of my businesses we built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge but i took that too far in my own behavior i wont make that mistake again i want any place i am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there i know my actions have disappointed many people the successes i have enjoyed are owned by everyone on my team the failures are mine alone to the people who have been at my side during this time my family my partners my employees my friends my fans i am grateful for your support and hopeful that i can regain your respect and trust i will spend the next period of time trying to do that batali remains an owner of his individual restaurants according to the bb spokesperson in a statement to eater bb said that while the company has had sexual harassment training and policies for more than 10 years it will now also enlist an independent outside corporate investigations firm for any staffers wishing to make claims against owners of the restaurants we take these allegations very seriously we pride ourselves on being a workplace for our employees where they can grow and deliver great service with equal opportunity and free from any discrimination we have strong policies and practices in place that address sexual harassment we train employees in these policies and we enforce them up to and including termination bbs statement reads in part mr batali and we have agreed that he will step away from the companys operations including the restaurants and has already done so joe bastianich said in a statement right now im just focused on ensuring that our more than 1000 employees continue to have a safe and positive work environment an abc spokesperson said in a statement abc takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment while we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct although bb has been sued for sexual harassment before batalis own alleged inappropriate sexual misconduct has not previously been the subject of a lawsuit each of the women who spoke to eater asked to remain anonymous in part for fear of retaliation batali a celebrated and powerful chef holds enormous sway in the restaurant world and beyond eater is granting them anonymity but has corroborated their stories with friends family members or colleagues who were informed of the incidents as well as with publicly available information many of the people who spoke with eater said they were afraid of retribution for speaking out a woman who claims she was inappropriately touched while she worked for batali in the late 90s told eater he has clear intent on being threatening when he is wronged and the level of vindictiveness is very chilling so it never occurred to me to share tales out of school the multiple accusations of inappropriate touching and other misconduct emerged from an eater investigation that included interviews with dozens of industry professionals who have had interactions with the chef including nearly three dozen current and former batali employees batali who became a star as the host of one of food networks first hit tv shows molto mario has risen to the very top of the restaurant industry since starting out in a new jersey sandwich shop in the early 80s as a college student along with joe bastianich and lidia bastianich he is the force behind batali bastianich hospitality group which notably includes the new york city restaurants del posto and babbo each of which holds one michelin star five years ago bb reported more than 250 million in annual revenue batali is also a minority shareholder in the italianmarket chain eataly usa which has six locations across the country outside of his restaurants batali is the author of numerous cookbooks the face of nationally distributed jarred pasta sauces and other kitchen products and the jolly orangecrocswearing cohost of abcs daytime talk and cooking show the chew he also founded a child education and empowerment nonprofit and is active in red the nonprofit founded by celebrities bono and bobby shriver additionally batali owns a small percentage of ken friedman and april bloomfields landmark gastropub the spotted pig people eater spoke to within the industry often describe him as a friendly charming professional supportive and frequently generous person but his affable persona belies another more crude reputation according to dozens of interviews batalis lewdness his crass way of speaking about women and his focus on womens bodies have been well known within certain circles in the restaurant world according to people who spoke with eater a former server at p the nowshuttered west village restaurant where batali built his reputation throughout the 90s alleges that repeated physical harassment took place while batali was the chef steve crane who coowned p with batali until the chef decamped to start his future empire confirmed that he was told by multiple staff members of ongoing inappropriate behavior by batali though crane does not recall any specific details and was not in the kitchen to personally witness the incidents he said that he was told by several female staffers that batali had grabbed them from behind consistently made a variety of sexual comments and engaged in behavior like snapping bra straps i made it very clear to him that he needed to stop but i feel ashamed that this happened at p and my staff endured this behavior he said crane said that because they were partners in the restaurant he ultimately did not have the power to fire batali batali through a spokesperson denied that crane ever confronted him the former server alleges that on multiple occasions batali grabbed her from behind like a linebacker like a disgusting bear hug and pressed her body against his in hours of interviews with eater she described nearly two years of inappropriate behavior the grabbing would often occur while they were alone in a cramped passageway between the dining room and the kitchen she alleged he would breathe on me and sometimes take a deep inhale like he was smelling me she recalled when crane asked batali to stop batali would become more aggressive the server alleged some female staff eventually started asking crane to not confront batali with their complaints she added crane confirmed that after some women would complain they would ask him not to confront batali because he would only be more aggressive toward them restaurant culture in the 90s was generally known for being bawdy and sexual relationships between staff werent uncommon the former server said but batalis behavior was more about degradation than good humor she alleges this wasnt just some dirty jokes this was mean this was about asserting power he is awful lee mcgrath a chef who joined p a few years after batali left as chef told eater that when he was hired crane warned him dont even think about messing with the waitresses theyve been through hell with mario a different woman who worked for batali in the late 90s alleges that he touched her inappropriately on two different occasions the first incident allegedly took place soon after she started her job one day while she was in the dining room of the restaurant she said batali came up behind her catching her unaware and put his hand on half of my butt and he squeezed it she recalled later gently confronting batali who responded what are you a lesbian in a second incident that took place about three years later she alleges that while working next to batali in a small boxedin space he was seated in such a way that he blocked her exit when she had to get up he refused to move leaving her no choice but to straddle him in order to leave the space according to the woman she told batali that she needed to go to the bathroom batali who was reclining with his legs propped up allegedly told her if you want to get up youre going to have to climb over me when she returned he was still seated with his legs propped up again refusing to move she had to straddle him a second time she alleges it was disappointing again to have that happen and again humiliating she said yet another woman who worked for batali for about a year in the late aughts alleges that he lunged at her and grabbed her breasts during an industry party in 2011 a few years after she stopped working for him at the party she recalled that batali appeared drunk and she became concerned for his safety when she spotted him on a balcony standing slumped over when i noticed that he looked wobbly my instinct was concern she said when she walked over and tapped him on the shoulder he sprung up like he was startled and with his eyes wide open then immediately he lifted his arms straight up and grabbed both of my breasts she said i took a step back and i pushed him away and when i did that i remember he said oh come on in that moment i realized im just a body to him she said of the experience though at the time she no longer worked for batali she had worked for him a few years prior and said she believed they shared some mutual respect when ive seen him over the years i dont have a sense that he even remembers she said though she added i havent spoken to him about it the chef who alleged being groped at an industry party in new orleans about 10 years ago as described earlier said she remains appalled by his behavior he gets wasted hes arrogant and he acts like hes gods gift to women she said this is still your industry youre a leader in this industry if you behave this way what kind of example are you setting in addition to the allegations of improper physical contact several sources said that batali has a reputation for inappropriately using sexual innuendo in workplace conversation multiple people who work at or have worked at batali restaurants from the early 90s to now described behavior that ranges from mild creepiness to more severe misconduct both in interviews with eater and in publicly available documents the woman who was allegedly groped by batali on the balcony told eater i remember not being fully surprised that it happened because id seen him drunk and flirtatious with women and that flirting came in the form of talking and sitting really close id never witnessed anything during work hours it was always postwork but according to other interviews his inappropriate behavior happened at work too mcgrath the p chef who started about a year after batali left said that he eventually understood why he was given the warning to not harass the female waitstaff as two servers including one who spoke with eater began to relay accounts of batalis misconduct its like they had ptsd he said mcgrath remembers being told that there was a lot of hugging from behind and that batali would ask about their sex lives what color underwear they wore and other inappropriate questions another former female p staffer who worked at the restaurant earlier than the woman mentioned above said that batali could be generally nasty and a bully to both men and women he was constantly making overtly sexual and inappropriate comments she alleges though she doesnt remember physical touching she said that shes never worked for someone more inappropriate than batali at one point she wanted to take out an ad in the paper to say what an awful person he was because she thought it was unfair that he was getting so many accolades considering how terribly he treated people she said mario is smart and hes talented but i dont think that gives you the right to be disgusting she said the employee who batali allegedly groped shortly after she was hired said that she has witnessed a lot of grayarea affection with women like a lot of subliminal dissection of womens bodies telling women their asses looked good remarking on boobs the chefs boorish side has also been previously documented in the media in the 2006 book heat the writer bill buford provides a glimpse at the earlier years of babbo and batalis tenure on the food network noting crass behavior with two female prep chefs as well as an assistant and a set manager in one incident detailed in the book during a food and winefilled evening at batalis greenwich village trattoria lupa osteria romana buford writes that batali said to a female server its not fair i have this view all to myself when you bend over for dessert would you take off your blouse for the others a manager at a bb restaurant said that while he loves working for batali who has been good to the kitchen staff and very professional with both male and female chefs in his experience he has seen batali treat women outside of the kitchen crudely especially while intoxicated eater granted him anonymity as he is still employed by the company and fears losing his job i really like the guy and every sober interaction has been very professional but yeah hes gross the manager said he was always friendly but it was in this oh youre a pretty little girl kind of way gabriela acero a former maitre d and floor manager who worked at batalis greenwich village restaurant otto from 2012 to 2014 said i remember him complimenting my dress saying something like oh dont you look like the blossoming bosom of spring even then i was like oh jesus batalis reputation has left some of the women whod benefited from his power and influence with mixed feelings about their relationship with him hes championed the careers of numerous women his kitchen at del posto is led by a female executive chef and executive pastry chef its not because they have a vagina he said of the crew while at the fast company innovation festival in october its because theyre the smartest people for the job i feel very complicated feelings toward him the former employee who described two encounters with batali said in some ways he was very supportive and he used his power and influence to connect me the former employee who alleged having her breasts grabbed described working for batali as frequently professional i definitely felt way more reverential about him then than i do now she said these allegations come as dozens of prominent and powerful men have been toppled by accusations of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct in the restaurant industry notorious for its boysclub culture chef john besh was brought down by allegations of rampant sexual harassment in his restaurants and former jeangeorges pastry chef johnny iuzzini has been accused of sexual harassment by four women i think it says so much about how we just accept and move on and i think for a long time i just thought well he didnt rape me said the woman who alleged being grabbed at an industry party in 2011 but i remember it vividly it impacted me and i feel uneasy recalling it i just feel this major sense that im not the only one i feel really grateful for the cultural reckoning thats happening anyone with

finale of keeping up with the kardashians kim convinced her mom and sisters to meet with a communications coach so that they could each figure out how to answer the questions they tend to avoid during interviews and no stone was left unturned kourtney and khlo butt heads they document their workouts almost every day on snapchat but kourtney 38 and khlo 33 decided they wanted to produce something a little more professional for their fans a full workout video the idea quickly took on a life of its own and somehow the two agreed to start a fitness line together as well forcing khlo to put her alreadyintheworks athleisure line with her clothing company good american on hold but kourtney struggled to commit fully to the massive responsibility of the project and soon enough her sister had had it kourtney and i are a nothing brand right now were just not seeing eyetoeye she said sometimes i love having a partner but when youre just not in sync its a little frustrating eventually she realized she wasnt going to get what she needed from kourtney who herself acknowledged that the two sisters have different priorities i was hoping you and i could do something together but it doesnt really seem like this train is moving at the speed i want it to move said khlo for now i think its smart for me to move forward with good american in doing this kind of stuff go for it girl said kourtney admitting that shes not the fastestmoving person and tends to procrastinate youre like nate dogg youre only good for hooks quipped khlo you cant sell your own album media training after undergoing her own media training kim realized how beneficial it was and asked her family to give it a shot i just think itll be a really good idea to get prepared and have everyone face our fears she said i dont think you could ever be too prepared it was so helpful for me just to be aware of the things im saying i dont think the answer is to retreat you have be prepared that some day you might be asked a question you dont want to answer after some coaxing kim convinced kris kourtney khlo and kendall to meet with two communications coaches from clarity media training kylie whom multiple sources have confirmed to people is pregnant and expecting her first child with rapper travis scott next year has been largely absent from this season thus far and did not partake in the training throughout the session the family underwent an oncamera mock group interview followed by individual ones then rewatched the tapes to critique their answers and suffice it to say that the coaches did not hold back after opening their line of questioning by bringing up kims sex tape they went on to cover everything from kendalls pepsi commercial to robs explosive behavior forcing kris and her daughters to answer some of the most uncomfortable and personal questions about their family for the momager that focused almost entirely on her strained and today essentially nonexistent relationship with her exspouse caitlyn jenner after kendall 22 admitted that she and her sister kylie 20 kept a lot of their fathers secrets over the years from kris she confessed that that was what hurt her the most there were things that happened that they didnt tell me because they were told not to said kris 62 in reference to any signs that caitlyn formerly known as bruce wanted to be a woman im not resentful about it it just makes me really sad she continued because im a protective mom i would do anything for my kids and had i known some of the things they were experiencing it just broke my heart hearing some of that stuff kris also said her exs tellall memoir was full of inaccuracies when asked about her protestthemed pepsi commercial which the company pulled days after it was accused of trivializing the black lives matter movement following its release in april kendall prickled but acknowledged it was definitely a huge learning lesson there were a lot of things that were blinding me she said a lot of people i had faith in a lot of things i had trust in after commenting on her defensive body language the coaches suggested kendall tackle the topic more directly in the future i have learned so much over the last four years of my career she said ive learned that the only person thats ever going to truly truly look out for me is me it is really hard work the coaches decided to ask khlo about her reclusive brother rob 30 who is known to make headlines for his contentious relationship with his ex blac chyna 29 rob definitely wears his heart on his sleeve and when he loves he loves really really hard she responded with that being said when he gets hurt he hurts really really badly for kourtney the coaches focused their questions on her ex scott disick and the mother of three flailed helplessly giving up altogether at one point and laughing nervously but ultimately all of the women walked away from the experience with newfound confidence and knowledge well that wasnt fun admitted kris but i truly do see some value in this whole process we live our entire lives in front of the whole world and questions like this are going to keep coming for as long as i can foresee so it really does help to have some skills under my belt to convey what im trying to say kendall and kylie drama meanwhile kendall and her noticeably absent sister kylie were going through some issues of their own the two were trying to arrange a birthday party for a friend and wound up at each others throats over their two completely different ideas in the middle of the media training session kendall stormed out driven almost to tears over the situation but within hours they had worked it out offcamera its crazy because kylie and i theres always something said kendall we fought and then she literally came over that night and helped me make a whole dinner for me and 20 of my friends so we end up butting heads sometimes but at the end of the day shes my sister the spotlight on kris to cap off the episode kris decided to put her media training to use for an interview conducted by basketball legend kareem abduljabbar for the hollywood reporter answering questions spanning everything from the sexual nature of her daughters photos im very comfortable if theyre comfortable to their influence on plastic surgery trends if something makes you feel better about yourself then why not i think everybody has to make their own choice her final word of advice for anyone squirming away from certain topics expect the tough questions and have some sense of preparedness so that you feel confident in

required to strictly follow the banking kyc know your customer verification process this kyc is a process where players provide their personal information for verification so that banks can easily track each transaction which can lead to unruly suspension and blocks as a result decentralized blockchain technology is becoming more popular since no central institution monopolizes the regulation

politifact7669,1,statement by the president the white house office of the press secretary statement by the president rose garden 535 pm edt mr barden hello my name is mark barden just four months ago my wife jackie and i lost our son and our children james and natalie they lost their little brother daniel daniel was a firstgrader at sandy hook elementary school our sweet 7yearold daniel was one of 20 children six adults lost on december 14th i have to say it feels like it was just yesterday in our deepest grief we were supported by the love of our families and comforted by the love and prayers we received from millions of america from every corner of the country what happened in newtown can happen anywhere in any instant any dad in america could be in my shoes no one should feel the pain no one should feel our pain or the pain felt by the tens of thousands of people whove lost loved ones to senseless gun violence and thats why were here two weeks ago 12 of us from newtown came to meet with us senators and have a conversation about how to bring commonsense solutions to the issues of gun violence we came with a sense of hope optimistic that real conversation could begin that would ultimately save the lives of so many americans we met with dozens of democrats and republicans and shared with them pictures of our children our spouses our parents who lost their lives on december 14th expanded background checks wouldnt have saved our loved ones but still we came to support the bipartisan proposal from two senators both with a ratings from the nra a commonsense proposal supported by 90 percent of americans its a proposal that will save lives without interfering with the rights of responsible lawabiding gun owners well return home now disappointed but not defeated we return home with the determination that change will happen maybe not today but it will happen it will happen soon weve always known this would be a long road and we dont have the luxury of turning back we will keep moving forward and build public support for commonsense solutions in the areas of mental health school safety and gun safety we take strength from the children and loved ones that we lost and we carry a great faith in the american people on behalf of the sandy hook promise i would like to thank president obama vice president biden for their leadership and for standing strong and continuing to fight for a safer america i would like to thank senators toomey manchin schumer and kirk on coming together to seek common ground on legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and save lives and i would like to thank connecticuts senators blumenthal and murphy theyve been right with us they stood by us right from the very beginning from the first few hours after this tragedy they were with us we will not be defeated we are not defeated and we will not be defeated we are here now we will always be here because we have no other choice we are not going away and every day as more people are killed in this country because of gun violence our determination grows stronger we leave washington hoping that others both here and across the country will join us in making the sandy hook promise a pledge that wed had great hope that more us senators would take literally id like to end by repeating the words with which the sandy hook promise begins our hearts are broken our spirit is not thank you it is now my great pleasure to introduce the president of the united states of america barack obama the president a few months ago in response to too many tragedies including the shootings of a united states congresswoman gabby giffords whos here today and the murder of 20 innocent schoolchildren and their teachers this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence families that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders not just to honor the memory of their children but to protect the lives of all our children and a few minutes ago a minority in the united states senate decided it wasnt worth it they blocked commonsense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the senate gallery by now its well known that 90 percent of the american people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun were talking about convicted felons people convicted of domestic violence people with a severe mental illness ninety percent of americans support that idea most americans think thats already the law and a few minutes ago 90 percent of democrats in the senate just voted for that idea but its not going to happen because 90 percent of republicans in the senate just voted against that idea a majority of senators voted yes to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks but by this continuing distortion of senate rules a minority was able to block it from moving forward im going to speak plainly and honestly about whats happened here because the american people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen we had a democrat and a republican both gun owners both fierce defenders of our second amendment with a grades from the nra come together and worked together to write a commonsense compromise on background checks and i want to thank joe manchin and pat toomey for their courage in doing that that was not easy given their traditional strong support for second amendment rights as they said nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our second amendment rights all it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the internet so 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system their legislation showed respect for gun owners and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence and gabby giffords by the way is both shes a gun owner and a victim of gun violence she is a westerner and a moderate and she supports these background checks in fact even the nra used to support expanded background checks the current leader of the nra used to support these background checks so while this compromise didnt contain everything i wanted or everything that these families wanted it did represent progress it represented moderation and common sense thats why 90 percent of the american people supported it but instead of supporting this compromise the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill they claimed that it would create some sort of big brother gun registry even though the bill did the opposite this legislation in fact outlawed any registry plain and simple right there in the text but that didnt matter and unfortunately this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators and i talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks and theyre all good people i know all of them were shocked by tragedies like newtown and i also understand that they come from states that are strongly progun and i have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns and that both sides have to listen to each other but the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldnt want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun there were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldnt do this it came down to politics the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections they worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as antisecond amendment and obviously a lot of republicans had that fear but democrats had that fear too and so they caved to the pressure and they started looking for an excuse any excuse to vote no one common argument i heard was that this legislation wouldnt prevent all future massacres and thats true as i said from the start no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil we learned that tragically just two days ago but if action by congress could have saved one person one child a few hundred a few thousand if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our second amendment rights we had an obligation to try and this legislation met that test and too many senators failed theirs ive heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory and my question is a victory for who a victory for what all that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check that didnt make our kids safer victory for not doing something that 90 percent of americans 80 percent of republicans the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done it begs the question who are we here to represent ive heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced a prop somebody called them emotional blackmail some outlet said are they serious do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence dont have a right to weigh in on this issue do we think their emotions their loss is not relevant to this debate so all in all this was a pretty shameful day for washington but this effort is not over i want to make it clear to the american people we can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence so long as the american people dont give up on it even without congress my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities were going to address the barriers that prevent states from participating in the existing background check system were going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job were going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools but we can do more if congress gets its act together and if this congress refuses to listen to the american people and pass commonsense gun legislation then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters to all the people who supported this legislation law enforcement and responsible gun owners democrats and republicans urban moms rural hunters whoever you are you need to let your representatives in congress know that you are disappointed and that if they dont act this time you will remember come election time to the wide majority of nra households who supported this legislation you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in washington know they didnt represent your views on this one the point is those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate and as organized and as vocal as those who blocked these commonsense steps to help keep our kids safe ultimately you outnumber those who argued the other way but theyre better organized theyre better financed theyve been at it longer and they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time and thats the reason why you can have something that 90 percent of americans support and you cant get it through the senate or the house of representatives so to change washington you the american people are going to have to sustain some passion about this and when necessary youve got to send the right people to washington and that requires strength and it requires persistence and thats the one thing that these families should have inspired in all of us i still dont know how they have been able to muster up the strength to do what theyve doing over the last several weeks last several months and i see this as just round one when newtown happened i met with these families and i spoke to the community and i said something must be different right now were going to have to change thats what the whole country said everybody talked about how we were going to change something to make sure this didnt happen again just like everybody talked about how we needed to do something after aurora everybody talked about we needed change something after tucson and im assuming that the emotions that weve all felt since newtown the emotions that weve all felt since tucson and aurora and chicago the pain we share with these families and families all across the country whove lost a loved one to gun violence im assuming thats not a temporary thing im assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words i believe were going to be able to get this done sooner or later we are going to get this right the memories of these children demand it and so do the american people thank you very much everybody end 555 pm edt

have access to it now that abc news has done that we now know the white house we should know the comprehensive view of the white house on health care doesnt it instead give all of us an opportunity to go over it with a finetoothed comb tomorrow to see what we like and what we dont like is there any problem with that smith no we should but the problem is we only heard one side anybody who was watching abc today van susteren well hear it tomorrow well hear it tomorrow i mean people are going to pick it apart tomorrow in some ways now at least we know what the white house what the presidents doing smith we certainly know van susteren tomorrow we can pick apart smith yes well i hope you know if abc allows individuals to pick it apart tomorrow those watching abc will get both sides but right now theyve only gotten one side and it was like van susteren yes but smith it was like a rigged football game they had the president had home field advantage abc was the only referee the opposing team wasnt allowed on the field but abc didnt even allow ads that opposed the presidents health care plan to be aired van susteren well the ads is a wholly different thing and ill agree with you on the ads but tomorrow i bet that fox cnn even msnbc and nbc and cbs i bet they will all be critiquing what the president said about health care smith well van susteren and but for this forum tonight and its almost like a direct examination was tonight and now tomorrow everybody can cross examine it and but for today we wouldnt have that chance smith right but the problem with that is that the three networks who have 10 times the number of viewers as fox for example they have 24 million viewers fox has 25 million but the problem is that those three networks have all been given slanted coverage to the presidents health care plan you have abc since january for example they interviewed 58 people in favor of the health care plan only 18 opposed three to one they are not presenting both sides and the american people deserve to get both sides if theyre going to be able to make good decisions van susteren all right one hour on abc is 44 minutes taking into account all the abc news taking into account all the commercials tomorrow theres going to be you know the 247 of all the cables so im not so sure and i realize that they have more viewers on broadcast as opposed to cable news but we have so much more time on it that im not you know that i dont know how itll balance out but i guess i guess the other thing is that you know its like it seems to me that this is an opportunity for all of us for americans to now to look at it with a finetoothed comb and i may be the only one whos not scandalized by it and frankly i havent yet seen it so i got to take a look at it so smith well its van susteren it may even be premature for me to be scandalized anyway smith if youd seen how onesided it is youd be scandalized because it is not representing good journalism it has not presented both sides it is not giving the american people the facts you have a recent gallup poll for example that says on 9 percent of the american people think the news media reports the news accurately and fairly 9 percent so the van susteren well thats another thats thats a whole other issue but congressman maybe lets see in 24 hours whether or not everybody has gone over this and with a finetoothed comb you may be right but lets at least give it a shot tomorrow see whether this has been smith well i van susteren dissected smith i hope people will take the time to look at the other side they certainly didnt get it from abc van susteren thank you sir for joining us smith thank you van susteren sorry it couldnt be in person because i know youre busy voting thank you sir smith all

politifact3335,1,meet the press transcript for feb 27 2011 mr david gregory this sunday revolution in the middle east and the showdown at home over red ink in washington and in states like wisconsin mounting leadership tests for president obama as the battle lines of the 2012 campaign come into sharper view this morning how will the standoff in wisconsin end and is the fight there with the unions about ideology or shared sacrifice gov scott walker rwi its not just about the budget now and into the future its not just about jobs or workers this is ultimately about the future of our state mr gregory my guest the man at the center of the storm embattled republican governor scott walker also the future of the middle east remains in doubt as libya s brutal dictator cracks down on protesters pres barack obama his actions violate international norms and every standard of common decency this violence must stop mr gregory whats next and has the administration done enough joining me this morning from the site of such unrest earlier this month cairo egypt the ranking member on the senate armed services committee republican john mccain then our political roundtable what rising oil costs could mean to our own economy can washington avoid a government shutdown over spending and the rhetorical start to 2012 leading republicans exchanging blows and union activists mobilizing with us president of the aflcio richard trumka republican governor of mississippi and former rnc chairman haley barbour chairman of the congressional black caucus missouri congressman emanuel cleaver host of msnbc s the last word lawrence odonnell and editorial board member and columnist for the wall street journal kim strassel announcer from nbc news in washington meet the press with david gregory mr gregory good morning protests grew in madison wisconsin saturday after days of demonstrations there by pro labor supporters the standoff started two weeks ago after wisconsin republican governor scott walker proposed a budget balancing bill that would severely limit the rights of most public workers to collectively bargain the bill would also require them to pay for 126 percent of the total cost of their healthcare premiums and contribute almost 6 percent of their pay toward their pension benefits walker s proposal is an attempt to close the 137 million deficit in this years state budget a shortfall that is projected to grow to 36 billion in the next two years and here with us now from madison the man in the middle of all this wisconsin governor scott walker governor welcome to meet the press gov walker good morning good to be with you david mr gregory so that context is important because theres collective bargaining which youd like to limit and there are those the specific contributions that you asked the unions they said they would do that they would meet those demands so the question that comes up again and again is if you want to deal with the budget and the deficit why not take yes for an answer gov walker well because weve seen that actions speak louder than words for us to balance the 36 billion deficit we have but not only now but to ensure we can continue to do that in the future so our kids dont inherit these same dire consequences weve got to have assurances and over the past two weeks even after they made those promises weve seen local union after local union rush to their school boards their city councils their technical school boards and rush through contracts in the past two weeks that had no contributions to the pension and no contribution to health care and in fact in one case in janesville they actually were pushing through a pay increase actions do speak louder than words mr gregory but governor you could have extended the bill you could have extended the bill to those local government agencies you chose not to gov walker no thats just the opposite i was a local government official for eight years this bill precisely helps local governments and its effective once it passes in fact were were facing a 36 billion deficit like nearly every other state across the country were going to have to cut more than a billion dollars from our schools and local governments you know in new york and california where there are democrats for governors theyre doing that the difference here is with this budget repair bill we give those schools and local governments more almost a billion and a half dollars worth of savings so the savings they get from our budget repair bill exceed the amount mr gregory but gov walker that theyre cut from the next state budget mr gregory all right but let let me be clear if the unions who who it seems to me have been clear in saying that they would agree to those extra contributions if they did that and you say youre concerned about the budget shortfall why not accept that gov walker but what i my point is they cant because they the two people that suggested it are statewide union leaders there are a thousandplus municipalities theres four more than 424 school districts theres 72 counties i know i used to be a county executive for eight years i know that collective bargaining has to be done in every jurisdiction they cant guarantee that and the actions of those local unions over the past two weeks show that if they were serious about it they would have offered up contracts that that paid something for health care and something more for pensions but theyre not the the reality is even beyond the five and the 12 collective bargaining does have a cost in wisconsin a great example of that is we have in many of our school districts a requirement through collective bargaining contracts that they have to buy their health insurance from a company thats owned by our state teachers union wa trust because of that it costs them up to 68 68 million more than if they could just buy it from the state employee healthcare plan those are real costs about putting real money in the classroom instead of into these collective bargaining agreements and for me at the at the county level mr gregory whats one governor let me just stop you gov walker i tried to avoid layoffs mr gregory but what whats wrong with collective bargaining lets be clear so unions organize public employees theyre able to bargain not just about wages but also about health benefits and pension benefits what youre trying to do is say no you can just collectively bargain when it comes to how much you make but not those other benefits gov walker right mr gregory whats so wrong with that collective bargaining gov walker well our proposal is less restrictive than the federal government is today under barack obama he presides over a federal government where most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for for benefits nor for pay so what were asking for is something less restrictive than what the federal government has and in fact most federal employees mr gregory but i asked you a more specific question which is whats wrong with collective bargaining gov walker well for us its its about the fact that again as a local official i can tell you personally time and time again because of collective bargaining when we had tough budgets in the past when i was at the county presiding as the co there i tried to do modest changes of pension i tried to do modest changes in health care in fact one year i literally tried to do a 35 hour work week to try and avoid massive layoffs and furloughs and the union said forget it embodied emboldened by the fact that they had collective bargaining agreements they said go ahead literally lay off 400 or 500 people and to me laying off people in this economy is just completely unacceptable mr gregory let me let me ask you about gov walker if we do not get these changes and the senate democrats dont come back were going to be forced to make up the savings in layoffs and that to me is just unacceptable mr gregory i dont mean to we have a satellite delay here it sometimes gets us to bump up against each other but i want to focus on inconsistencies in some of your argument you do have exemptions here youve said were going to pass this bill but if youre a cop or a firefighter you dont have to make those extra contributions and you can still collectively bargain you seem to be picking winners and losers cops and firefighters dont have to join this are they more important than a teacher who spends six hours a day with children in wisconsin gov walker no this is not a value judgment about employees but it is ultimately about preserving public safety we saw two weeks ago when this debate first started teachers here in madison walked off the job for three days now that was an inconvenience for a lot of parents i know ive got two public kids in public school anytime you have a disturbance like that its an inconvenience but that contrasted to the fact that even if there was one jurisdiction across the state where firefighters or police officers werent on the job in full force i cant afford to have a fire or crime committed where theres a gap in service and it ultimately just boils down to public safety mr gregory well but again if youre talking about austerity and you want to deal with this budget deficit doesnt there have to be a sense of shared sacrifice that everybody gets hurt gov walker well there is im a well im affecting my family about this the legislature my cabinet in fact as elected officials well pay a higher dollar amount a higher percentage because of these changes to show that were that serious about it now the the statewide firefighters union president has come out and said theyd take the five and the 12 i would suggest to every mayor out there that they take them up on that but in terms of making that change i cant afford to have a gap when it comes to public safety i think thats the one thing universally republican and democrat alike liberal or conservative that people know that we cannot have a gap in and thats why we made that change in the bill mr gregory you were the subject of a crank call a liberal blogger who was trying to draw you into to a conversation about all of this gov walker right mr gregory and and you had a serious conversation not knowing who you were talking to and you talked about ronald reagan gov walker right mr gregory and him taking on the unions and the air traffic controllers and you talked about putting this moment in some kind of context this is part of what you said gov walker in wisconsin s history little did i know how big it would be nationally in wisconsin s history i said this is our moment this is our time to change the course of history mr gregory change the course of history and this is where critics say you know this governor is really more of an ideologue than someone who wants to solve a serious problem youre going farther than other republicans who have taken on pension and healthcare costs to really go active after collective bargaining and by your own admission youre saying well theres some areas where we just cant afford that level of austerity but if youre serious about austerity doesnt it have to be a situation where everybody gets affected gov walker well in the end the reason i made that comment i do believe that this is our moment in wisconsin s history its one of those where for year after year after year not just the last governor but governors before legislatures before have kicked the can theyve taken onetime fixes to push the budget problems off into the future we cant do that were broke like nearly every other state across the country were broke and its about time somebody stood up and told the truth in this state and said heres our problem heres the solution and acted on it because if we dont we fail to make a commitment to the future our children will face even more dire consequences than what we face today mr gregory but governor if you if you say youre broke gov walker so i i make no apology for the fact that this is an important moment in time mr gregory governor if youre really serious about the state being broke you have a deal that you could take to get the contributions you need to solve the problem at hand why not separate that out from your views about collective bargaining gov walker but but david my point is repeatedly as a former local government official i know that collective bargaining has a cost and when im cutting out more a billion dollars from aid to local governments in this next twoyear budget i need to do what no other governors doing across the country theyre all cutting all but a handful are cutting the difference is where we want to be unique in wisconsin is we have to give those local governments the tools and it goes beyond the 5 and the 12 percent and as i mentioned repeatedly i dont think we can take that 5 and 12 percent to the bank mr gregory are you needless dividing your state gov walker because unions have shown us the last two weeks that that theyre not going to do it no i think in the end the best way for us to move forward is for those 14 state senators the state assembly did their job democrats in the assembly stood up made their argument made their case did what they were elected to do the assembly passed it it is now at a point where we want to move forward its real simple those 14 state senators need to come back and do what they were elected to do come back here they dont have to vote for it they dont have to support it but they need to come back and do their job and when we do i have every belief that the first four five weeks were in office we passed an aggressive agenda that showed that wisconsin is open for business many of those same senate democrats voted with me on those measures we can get back to that if they just come back and do the job they were elected to do mr gregory and if they dont if they dont governor how does this end gov walker well im an optimist im an eternal optimist as much as i understand theres passion and thats you know in america thats great we can have passion and be civil about it but in the end i believe that those at least some of those state senators will come back if we fail to pass this bill by tuesday we lose 165 million worth of savings if we continue down that path we start seeing layoffs i know that was one of the most difficult decisions i ever had to make when i was a county official was considering layoffs i would go to almost any ends to avoid that my hope is at least one of those 14 state senators feels the same way mr gregory governor final question here i want to clarify something in the course of this prank this crank call that you got gov walker mmhmm mr gregory it was suggested by someone who was a liberal blogger that you might think about planting troublemakers into the crowd and you said quote we thought about that is that right you really thought about trying to bust up physically these protests gov walker no we thought as the call continues and ive said repeatedly we we rejected that but we have people all the time who contact us for and against this bill and you can imagine people with all sorts of ideas and suggestions and we look at everything thats out there but the bottom line is we rejected that because we have had a civil discourse weve had you know a week ago 70000 people we had more than that yesterday and yet we havent had problems here we havent had disturbances weve just had very passionate protesters for and against this bill and thats ok thats a very midwestern thing but were not going to allow anybody to come in from outside of this state and try and disrupt this debate they can inform it but were not going to allow them to disrupt this debate and take the focus off the real issue here and the issue is the people in wisconsin particularly those 14 state senators need to come home and have the debate here in the state capitol mr gregory all right governor walker we will leave it there thank you very much gov walker thank you david mr gregory and well have much more on this debate coming up in our political roundtable where we will be joined by aflcio president richard trumka but first to discuss the other big story this week the unrest in the middle east and the violence in libya by the regime of moammar gadhafi we want to bring in the ranking member of the senate armed services committee john mccain who has been traveling in the middle east this week including stops in tunisia lebanon and jordan and he joins us this morning from the very busy cairo senator mccain welcome sen john mccain raz thank you david mr gregory i want to ask you first about libya and events that are moving very quickly including the us response the president has made it clear that he wants gadhafi to go his ambassador to the united nations susan rice speaking after a vote in the security council in favor of sanctions against libya imposing an arms embargo urging member countries to freeze assets of the gadhafi family and this is what ambassador rice said during that debate dr susan rice when a leaders only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now mr gregory senator the question is how is that achieved sen mccain well first of all i agree with that statement but id also like to point out that we could impose and could have imposed a nofly zone they wouldve stopped flying if that had been imposed theyre using air power and helicopters to continue these massacres we should recognize a provisional government somewhere in eastern libya perhaps benghazi we should make it clear that we will provide assistance to that provisional government and finally we should make it absolutely clear that anyone who continues or is in engaged in these kinds of barbarous acts are going to find themselves on trial in a war crimes tribunal weve got to really get tough mr gregory and and by get tough if you talk about a nofly zone would you stop short there i mean youre youre certainly raising the specter of some kind of military intervention on the part of the us and its allies to stop gadhafi to force him to go sen mccain well i think that providing the socalled provisional government and there will be one with the equipment and material that they could use the nofly zone i think would be a very strong signal im not ready to use ground forces or further intervention than that look gadhafi s days are numbered the question is how many and how many people are going to be massacred before he leaves one way or the other i think those measures that i just mentioned could hasten his demise mr gregory let me ask you about egypt we have an image of you earlier in the day in tahrir square where there are still protesters the critical question is building the building blocks of a democratic government there how is that going sen mccain i think its going along we met with some of the young opposition leaders these real heroes i was in awe to be in their company about what needs to happen there are still significant divisions but i think they are headed in the right direction i think there are questions about how soon to have an election whether to have a presidential election before the parliamentary elections but i believe that theres every good chance they can succeed mr gregory senator mccain youre in the region were watching what could be called an arab spring an historic movement its also a gamechanging movement for the united states and our interests there its my understanding the president has ordered a complete review of middle east strategy i know that our defense leaders have also called for instant contingency planning as you survey the area how do we reassess both emergencies there and our interests there sen mccain well first of all im not sure that this winds of change are going to be confined to blowing just in the arab world and the maghreb i think its going to be all over the world to wit whats happening in china and in other countries around the world second of all the return to our fundamentals and that is that all of us are endowed with certain inalienable rights respect democracy further it recognize that the longer theres a dictatorship the bigger the explosion is going to be once that people become dissatisfied enough recognize that that we have to assist these countries and it is in our national interest to do so and the economy is a vital and the most important permanent part of any successful transition to democracy and freedom and frankly we shouldve done more in the past i think we should all admit that mr gregory but what about contingency planning are there contingencies that may arise now that are particularly worrisome to you sen mccain i think its not clear where this revolution goes in in all of these countries and every country is very different from each other i think we should understand that iran can take advantage of this unsettling situations in these countries we should be standing up for democracy in iran we should be backing their protesters with our moral support which we didnt in 2009 mr gregory i want to ask to get your reaction about something that secretary of defense robert gates has said this week about us intervention into the middle east and into asia this is what he said at west point on friday mr robert gates in my opinion any future defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big american land army into asia or into the middle east or africa should have his head examined as general mcarthur so delicately put it mr gregory how do you respond to that senator sen mccain i have the highest regard for secretary gates i think hes one of the finest secretaries of defense in the history of our country and a great patriot i think there are times however and im sure he would say this where it does require us military intervention afghanistan was the genesis of 911 as you know we had to stamp out the situation get the situation there under control so that it would not continue to be a base for attacks on the united states and our allies but i also understand the implications of the needs of a new kind of warfare to counter this radical islamic extremism wherever it rears its head particularly in those continents that he referred to mr gregory finally senator mccain i just wanted to get your reaction to something that came out of rolling stone magazine that im sure youre aware of this week here was a picture with you in kabul with lieutenant general william caldwell and this is the piece by rolling stone featuring him it says this the us army illegally ordered a team of soldiers specializing in psychological operations to manipulate visiting american senators into providing more troops and funding for the war rolling stone has learned and when an officer tried to stop the operation he was railroaded by military investigators as you know general petraeus is now investigating this what happened sen mccain well you know thats been tried on me in the past david i dont know whats happened i do know that the general caldwell is a great leader and has done a great job in leading the afghan army i also know that these briefers are briefed you know senator x is interested in the following a b c d and e and and that and that i think is perfectly legitimate now if it went any further than that i dont know general petraeus will make a full investigation general caldwell has steadfastly denied it but i dont see how it could have affected my positions in any way and so well see what happens but ive im put me down as skeptical mr gregory senator mccain we will leave it there thank you very much and safe travels and coming up next as a government shutdown looms budget battles front and center in the capitol and in statehouses across the country ground zero for it all this week wisconsin what is at stake there what will it mean for the rights of workers and how will it all impact the 2012 race for the white house our political roundtable weighs in well be joined by aflcio president richard trumka mississippi governor haley barbour the chairman of the congressional black caucus emanuel cleaver msnbc s lawrence odonnell and the wall street journal s kim strassel mr gregory coming up what will the budget battles taking place across the country mean for the race for the white house in 2012 our roundtable weighs in its up next after this brief commercial break mr gregory we are back now with our political roundtable the president of the afl cio richard trumka the republican governor of mississippi former rnc chairman haley barbour chairman of the congressional black caucus missouri congressman democrat emanuel cleaver editorial board member and columnist for the wall street journal kim strassel and the host of msnbc s the last word lawrence odonnell who spent a long time on capitol hill in the early 90s including several years as the chief of staff to the senate finance committee so hes seen some of these fights before welcome to all of you mr trumka welcome to the program you heard governor walker this is an important moment for unions and as he says it for taxpayers how do you respond to what he says mr richard trumka well first of all this isnt about the budget crisis lets look at how this his arguments migrated first he said it was the budget crisis was caused because workers were paid too much in wisconsin we now have studies that show theyre not overpaid theyre underpaid in fact people with a degree in wisconsin get 25 percent less than their private sector things then he said it was about the pension now we find out that his pension plan unlike a lot in the country is almost fully funded the assets match the liabilities and then the employees said or the members out there said his workers said well accept your cuts and he said no we wont accept your accepting our cuts and the most outrageous thing that he did and he talked about this was hes now saying to them you either have to accept a loss of your rights or im going to lay you off now no person should have to face the right of their loss of their job or the loss of their rights i know governor barbour would never say to his employees his people down there you either have to give up your rights or you have to give up your job mr gregory let me let me follow up on one point a lot of people who are following this may be confused but certainly have questions about the role of public sector unions and there does something that seem seem to be distorted you raise a lot of money from public employees that goes goes to finance campaigns to try to get somebody in office that you can do business with and ultimately youre supporting someone in some cases that youre ultimately negotiating with they also know that political employees rather public employees are politically active because theyre organized by the unions and so they make concessions on things like pensions on health care knowing that the promises dont come due to well down the road isnt this the cycle that weve gotten into that public unions have to take some responsibility for mr trumka well public employees do take responsibility for it and those governors that are willing to sit down and work with their employees can actually work out problems they we can solve them but thats not what governor walker is doing hes saying i wont talk to you ill talk to all my my big contributors he talked to the koch brothers he thought but i wont talk to employees look the five countries or the five states in this country that prohibit collective bargaining by state employees have a collective debt right now of 220 billion this isnt about employees this is about the economy mr gregory so mr trumka what we need to do is create jobs and thats what we should be doing mr gregory all right and well get to that mr trumka working together mr gregory governor governor barbour this is the question that i posed at the beginning of the program is this is this an ideologue is this just about ideology is it about union busting or is it about really getting serious about shared sacrifice gov haley barbour rms well its about budgets it is about the fact that wisconsin like many states is broke and the idea is ok lets make a very narrow agreement over wages and and for one year is going to solve the problem governor walker understands as every governor understands it is not enough just to kick the can down the road to next year because these problems snowball they cascade and thats why its critical to get ahold of this for most states the well the pay mr gregory but he but his argument is that the unions are so unreasonable they wont ultimately make concessions theyve made the concession gov barbour for a year mr gregory yeah gov barbour thats the whole problem theyve got to change the system about half the states in the country dont allow or limited limit collective bargaining the federal government doesnt have collective bargaining for wages for health benefits i mean this people act like this is some right you know that these are collective bargaining rights theres no right to this under the constitution mr gregory lawrence odonnell how do you read this mr lawrence odonnell well you know one of the things i was struck by in your interview with the governor is just to go back to a point is that he said that he rejected rejected the idea of sending in troublemakers to the demonstrations that means the idea was discussed that means someone in the governors office said how about we send some people in there to cause physical trouble in these demonstrations and this governor thought about it discussed it rejected it ok he rejected it but to say he rejected it and think well thats the end of it thats a noncontroversial moment its quite shocking to think that there was a governor thinking about that gov barbour well larry you added the word physical nobody ever you could talk about should you send people out there to talk to the employees mr odonnell ok lets lets just ok ill ill retract that lets just say troublemakers this its its shocking to think the governor among the things they were discussing was should we send in troublemakers how long did you would you have to discuss that mr gregory let met bring in congressman cleaver i mean you were on this program last month after the shooting of gabby giffords we talked about tone we talked about inappropriate public discourse and i want to show you some of the placards that have been used by demonstrators pro union supporters out there they have cast the governor this one here one dictator to go one dictator down talking about hosni mubarak he has been compared to hitler we spent time on this program talking about the nonsense about obama being a muslim or not being born in america and asking republicans if they reject that should that kind of discourse be rejected in this fight rep emanuel cleaver dmo absolutely its inappropriate it should be condemned not only by people close to the governor but by those of us who are observers i think thats something that weve got to squash in in this country weve come to a a a a point in this government discussion where you know one side says anything goes to get my point across and i i think it would be certainly something that i would condemn but but but it goes even further than that were not even involved in trying to solve the problems one side proposes the other side opposes thats why were not making progress the you know the the governor is saying here you know you know you come back lets lets prevent me laying off employees if you when when the lion and the lamb lie down if you look closely when the lion gets up the lamb is missing when the governor says come back home hes not saying lets negotiate hes saying come back home so i can do what i want to do to the unions mr gregory kim strassel i want i want to bring you in on this and the president said this was an assault on unions ms kim strassel mmhmm mr gregory hes then gone quiet back in 2007 on the campaign trail this is what he said if this were to ever come to pass pres obama and understand this if american workers are being denied their right to organize and collectively bargain when im in the white house ill put on a comfortable pair of shoes myself ill walk on that picket line with you as president of the united states of america because workers deserve to know that somebodys standing in their corner mr gregory so here he said it was an assault on unions in the past he said ill be out there walking with you hes now gone silent meantime hes trying to move to the center politically and try to create jobs hes put himself in a difficult political situation here ms strassel well as the governor says he needs to have a pair of shoes on picketing around washington dc because federal workers are not allowed any of these collectively bargaining rights that hes talking about there look one of the problems here is that i think the problem for democrats and unions in this is that its not necessarily a winning issue here whats going on in the states is a microcosm of the federal debate and that is about fiscal responsibility right now what these governors are saying and its chris christie in new jersey its scott walker in wisconsin its john kasich in ohio mr gregory but theyre not going as far on collective bargaining not in new jersey not in indiana ms strassel right but were talking about the bigger issue about budgets mr gregory mmhmm ms strassel and how you deal with budgets you even have democrats like andrew cuomo in new york saying when we look at these budgets huge ballooning areas of these budgets are due to public sector union benefits and we cannot touch them because of collective bargaining because of these things we need the flexibilities and tools to fix this and so thats a thats an argument that resonates with americans people are talking about trying to cast this as the middle an assault on the middle class it was middle class taxpayers who elected these guys mr gregory well richard trumka ms strassel they campaigned on it they elected them they put them in office to do this mr gregory is is is president obama doing enough is he satisfying you mr trumka look its important for the president for middle class voters to know that the president is on their side mr gregory right mr trumka but this isnt about president obama mr gregory no but im asking you whether hes doing enough mr trumka this is about a governor wait mr gregory you heard what he said in 2007 mr trumka this is about a governor mr gregory hed be out there with you hes not out there with you mr trumka david this is about a governor whos taken on nurses and emts mr gregory mr trumka but answer the question i asked a very specific question the president in 2007 as a candidate said if this ever happened id be with you do you think hes with you mr trumka i think i think hes doing it the right way hes not taking on workers like scott walker is mr gregory hm mr trumka and trying to take away their ability to come together and negotiate a middle class way of life he stands for that hes doing that mr gregory could he be doing more mr trumka he could everybody could be doing more mr gregory well thats but in this particular case i mean lawrence i want to go back to the politics here it is very difficult for a president who wants to move to the center to before the cannon you know after it fired initially he said its an assault on unions then hes gone quiet and now hes hes hes got unhappiness on the left and on the right and he just wants to be more of a centrist guy right now mr odonnell it would be interesting to see what his choice would be if he was in a second term mr gregory hm mr odonnell this is someone who won wisconsin he has to win wisconsin again there is chaos there right now politically he doesnt know how this is going to play three months from now if a large majority or significant majority of wisconsin likes the outcome whatever it is a few months from now thats where the president wants to be going into his re election there mr gregory and you know talking about mr odonnell so thats why hes staying out of it mr gregory well and i want to talk about the politics some more howard fineman in the huffington post had an analysis about this and how in many ways this is about the gop s attempts to win more governor seats around the country he talks about it the real political math in wisconsin what happened why did republicans only get 12 this last goround well according to gop strategists and governor haley barbour of mississippi who chaired the rga in 2010 the power and money of publicemployee unions was the reason the gop strategic aim is simple enough if they can abolish union collectivebargaining rights they can undermine the automatic payment of dues to the publicemployee union treasuries shrinking those treasuries and reducing the union structure and membership will make it harder for democrats to communicate directly with workers mr trumka there it is gov barbour now thats what howard said mr gregory right thats gov barbour thats what howard said mr gregory no no but gov barbour thats what howard said mr trumka do you disagree with him gov barbour look this is about this is a state issue in a state where theyve got serious budget problems because payroll pensions are such a huge part of the budget you got to deal with it and you cant deal with it for one year i have some mr gregory this is a national movement i thought i thought it was a national movement ok gov barbour lets talk about you asked about the president mr gregory yeah gov barbour the president is one of the greatest politicians in the history of the united states and he and hes quiet because he understands that most americans know this has to be done mr gregory congressman where hold on let me get congressman rep cleaver lets sue him for breach of promise and move on i mean lets you know the reality is that the the the president needs to be in washington dealing with a plethora of issues around the world not the least of which is libya but i want to go back to something that that you said actually twice governor and and that is you said you know this is would be a oneyear agreement the governor was just elected hell still be governor in a year and you know the the the agreements that we have were not made by gadhafi they were made by people who sat down in a room and worked out a worked out an agreement and i think labor unions are saying and and public sector employees are saying ok you know maybe things have gotten out of balance well well well reduce some things the governor is saying i dont care you know i want to crush the union mr gregory i want to i want to get to a break richard trumka i want to ask you one thing again about the tone of the debate youre one of the leading labor voices in the country do you condemn the hyperbole the overstatements comparisons to hitler and dictators do you think thats wrong on the part of pro union supporters mr trumka we want to i look we ought to pro anti union it doesnt matter mr gregory its inappropriate mr trumka we should be sitting down trying to create jobs when and look if you think that the argument that youre doing in wisconsin is winning as you said kim the polls show that every wisconsin vast majority of the people think this governor has overreached his popularity has gone down theyre saying to him sit down and negotiate dont do what youve been doing so hes losing if thats the argument youre going to do this year or next year its a loser for for anybody who advocates it mr odonnell and i dont know why you fear democracy so much youre saying that this is a temporary agreement its a its a result of democracy in wisconsin republicans won wisconsin and and the and republicans ran on this and now theyre doing this if the idea remains popular and if it has democratic support in wisconsin meaning support of the democracy of wisconsin why would you worry about leaving this agreement out there so that it and allowing collective bargaining so that the wisconsin can democratically express itself in the future as being in favor or opposed to more or less government spending on workers gov barbour well larry it it is precisely because i do believe in democracy we had an election in 2010 and wisconsin voted for a republican governor a republican senator two republican houses of the legislature and they have determined this is the best way to go forward to get the budget of that state in effect which they were elected to do look at indiana in indiana this was done six years ago by the governor it has been very popular nobody put mitch daniels picture with a with a crosshair over his face like theyre doing in wisconsin you know if sarah palin did that you know ms strassel well gov barbour it would be the world coming to an end mr gregory all right quick kim quick point and then i want to get to a break ms strassel well actually in fairness i mean governor daniels was did get some blowback when he did this six years ago mr gregory yeah ms strassel and his approval ratings did go down but the problem the question is what happens in the end people want to see balanced budgets and whats interesting is governor daniels is one of the few states because he ended up with that flexibility in his budget to negotiate hes had been in the black for the past five or six years even when other states have not mr gregory all right let me get a break in here i want to talk a little bit about the budget woes here in washington as well as whats going on in the middle east right after this mr gregory we are back with our roundtable congressman cleaver i want to talk about the presidents budget and the spending showdown here in washington were actually not talking a great deal about the budget yet because theres this prospect of a government shutdown because republicans democrats cant seem eye to see eye to eye on spending for just the rest of this fiscal year this is a statement that you put out about the presidents budget and i ll put it up on the screen rebuilding our economy you wrote on the backs of the most vulnerable americans is something i simply cannot accept i understand that now is the time for us as a nation to sacrifice in order to protect our children from a certain amount of debt however im struggling to understand how this budget helps us best to achieve this critical goal cutting funding to programs that assist hardworking americans help families heat their homes and expand access to graduatelevel education seems to conflict with the notion of winning the future we cannot win the future by leaving our most vulnerable behind do we have the balance wrong as we approach spending this year and look ahead to the presidents budget rep cleaver absolutely let me let me preface my comment on that by by just saying you know disagreement does not equal disassociation or disaffection and disagreement among friends is the insignia of a healthy relationship weve weve got to disagree with the president when we think that hes moving in a direction thats disturbing but at the same time i do think that real cuts needs to be made but but lets keep in in mind you know i think were dangerously cutting ben bernanke has warned congress in in a hearing that cavernous cuts could hurt what is a rickety recovery and goldman sachs in in in an analysis released last week said that even if the proposed cuts are reduced to 25 billion for the first year and 50 billion for next year that it would still create a a 1 percent cut in economic growth of the gdp mr gregory but but lawrence there is a stopgap measure that looks like itll head off a shutdown but then the presidents still going to have to engage on the fact that republicans democrats are far apart on these huge cuts republicans want for this year mr odonnell they are it looks like theyre going to avoid this fridays possible shutdown and and have a two week extension they seem to have agreed on that by john boehner basically taking the cuts the president has identified in the future and saying lets start doing them now that thats the cut package that they will include in their ongoing resolution but the problem with this dialogue is it all begins after our failure on recognizing what the top tax rate burdens should really be and and keeping them down has created this much more serious deficit situation going forward weve been ignoring for years the reality of what has happened in the super rich level of income in this country we should have several higher top tax brackets it shouldnt stop at a couple of hundred thousand dollars we have incomes we have shortstops making 15 million who are paying the same tax rate as you know two ucla married professors this is outrageous we have people on wall street in deals making 300 million in a day and they pay that same top tax rate as people making a couple of hundred thousand dollars and so were ignoring this massive revenue possibility in the high end of incomes in this country mr gregory and as this debate goes on kim you can respond to that but i also want to talk about another threat to the economy that is coming from the events that were talking about in the middle east i thought this cartoon by jim margulies captured it a syndicated cartoonist the price of liberty he says in the cartoon is 500 a gallon and were talking about libya only 2 percent of the oil market but very important in europe ms strassel mmhmm mr gregory and its the speculation that causes folks to pay more for gas here how does this imperil this economy ms strassel no that that is the real problem is speculation at the moment as you said libya is 3 percent of the oil market and youve already had the saudis come out and say we can replace the oil thats not coming out of libya what youre seeing here is is traders worried that this arab revolt is going to spread to places like saudi and they are building in some of that worry into the price thats why youve seen the spike this acts as a tax on the economy you know every time we i think we import 75 or we use 75 billion barrels of oil a year every time 10 a barrel price hike thats a huge new tax on the economy now some of this by the way i should point out isnt just libya and speculation were also seeing in here part of ben bernanke s quantitative easing and inflation working its way into oil prices as well gov barbour were also mr gregory yeah gov barbour were also seeing david the administrations energy policy which is driving down american oil production i mean the shutting down of the gulf of mexico taking lands in alaska off the the issues that they are raising america s going to produce about 13 percent more domestic petroleum this year now how is that in our interest at a time like this or at any other time mr gregory you you talk about that in terms of energy policy as someone who may run for president and well talk more about politics after the break as you look at the middle east what concerns you about us posture toward that region gov barbour well look im one of these guys who believes as senator vandenberg used to say that in politics it should stop at the waters edge when it comes to foreign policy im not going to be critical of the administration but i do think on their domestic energy policy it is greatly compounding this problem were blowing past 3 a gallon on our way to 4 a gallon maybe jim margulies is right four dollar gasoline brought my state and a lot of places to their knees in 2008 before there ever was a meltdown on wall street mr gregory all right let me let me get another break in here well come back talk politics for 2012 and what wisconsin means for that and a couple of other topics when we come back with our roundtable right after this mr gregory were back with our final moments with our roundtable everything has political implications lets talk about the politics the news this week for 2012 senator thune has decided that he will not run for president john thune from south dakota and you look at the gallup poll and heres the list this crowded field huckabee and romney look to be at the top and theres governor barbour at 3 percent and governor as you look at this and this the field continues to be unsettled how will you make the calculation about whether youll run gov barbour i didnt know my family was that big 3 percent its a its a very critical decision its a family decision in many ways in fact in most ways but im not going to make a decision until april im going to finish my legislature get my job done get my budget passed mr gregory but how do you decide but how to make that calculation based on what youre seeing gov barbour well mr gregory because there seems to be a lot of late entries here gov barbour whether or not anybody else runs is irrelevant to my decision im going to make the decision based on things that i think and i dont want to take everybody else s time going through all the things that i would have to think mr gregory yeah gov barbour that i am thinking about mr gregory richard trumka how do you assess that republican field right now who youll be organizing against mr trumka well theyll be a lot of them probably mr gregory yeah mr trumka but mr gregory is there a frontrunner mr trumka i well mr gregory do you whos most formidable in your mind mr trumka i dont know i wouldnt go there i wouldnt go there on either side the democrats or republicans thats a debate that needs to take place but you know governor walker what hes done and people like him governors like him theyve energized the working class voters and that momentum that weve picked up the demonstrations that youre seeing in madison isnt just in madison theyre around the country and that momentum is going to continue on and haley i hope you dont stake your whole campaign on taking away the right of workers to be able to earn a middle class income because i dont think thats a winner for you at this time gov barbour well i want to stake my campaign on the right of taxpayers to be able to pay so that the state employees can keep their jobs and dont have to be laid off mr gregory let let let me ask you mr trumka those state those state those state workers are taxpayers mr gregory let me ask about about about health care lawrence odonnell as mike huckabee the former arkansas governor who has taken on mitt romney this is what he said in the associated associated press as they covered it huckabee said wednesday that potential white house rival romney should offer an apologize for healthcare overhaul that he oversaw as massachusetts governor quoting him i think its not a killer for him but he has to say either i love it i hate it or hey i tried it it didnt work and thats why i should say to you lets not do it nationally he goes on hes got to figure out how he wants to deal with it its the 800pound elephant in the room for him now romney has stood by it but said its something that the states should work out mr odonnell well huckabee is right in identifying this is whats wrong with the romney candidacy and in fact you can go down through the list and do that with pretty much every one of the possible republican candidates with the exception of tim pawlenty who i think is the one who is going to start moving ahead because he has no serious negative you have thoughtful republicans starting to support him the ideal candidate is a midwesterner and that usually is true for both parties because thats where the battleground states are with thune dropping out pawlenty becomes more important in the field but romney has the same this is identical virtually identical politically to the problem hillary clinton had going into that primary field where she had to disown or own the vote in support of the iraq war this is much more serious the the what what romney did on health care is much more difficult thing to overcome in the primaries i dont think he can ms strassel i think thats not not alone i actually thats not the only issue and i actually agree with richard here that what is happening in wisconsin is going to have very big implications for the the primaries on both sides and in particular in this case because the other 800pound gorilla in the room besides health care is fiscal responsibility mr gregory right ms strassel you see the president entirely focused on it at the moment and this is going to play into republican governors mr gregory and congressman ms strassel in particular who are running and their record in the states mr gregory are are republicans running circles around democrats and the president on the issue of fiscal responsibility from the states to cutting in washington is that how you view it rep cleaver no absolutely not the what what the republicans are mistakenly doing is pushing cuts that will hurt the very people who voted for them and when people realize what is happening to them and their families there will be i think a great deal of buyers regret and well look up and see that president obama is surging again to to beat somebody you got to run somebody this is the only person that im endorsing to run against barack obama at the moment mr gregory yeah really youd endorse governor barbour rep cleaver to run against barack obama mr gregory to run against him ok rep cleaver you know david mr gregory were going to were going to have to leave it there were out of time thanks to all of you i just wanted to make sure i didnt miss an endorsement there before we go a quick programming note you can watch the rebroadcast of todays program this afternoon on msnbc at 2 pm eastern followed by a reairing of chris matthew s special president of the world the bill clinton phenomenon thats at 3 pm eastern time that is all for today we will be back next week if its

issue for the past three years78 in 2016 li stated that he was accepting fewer film offers due to his charity work rather than his illness from which he had recovered79 li likes to play badminton and table tennis ride his bicycle read and meditate in his free time he collects rare tibetan beads8081 views on life and martial arts li as a buddhist believes that the difficulties of everyday life can be overcome with the help of religious philosophies82 he thinks that fame is not something he can control therefore he does not care about it83 i never say to myself im the best fighter in the world if someone learns martial arts solely to pick fights on the street to lean on it as a keystone weapon in conflicts to use it to bully and intimidate others then that person in my opinion cannot be considered a true martial artist84 according to li everything he has ever wanted to tell the world can be found in three of his films the message of hero is that the suffering of one person can never be as significant as the suffering of a nation unleashed shows that violence is never a solution and fearless tells that the biggest enemy of a person is himself li thinks that the greatest weapon is a smile and the largest power is love85 about wushu he said that he believes the essence of martial arts is not power or speed but inner harmony and considers it a sad development that todays wushu championships place greater emphasis on form than on the essence of being a martial artist he believes wushu now lacks individuality and competitors move like machines whereas according to his views wushu should not be considered a race where the fastest athlete wins he would like to see wushu as a form of art where artists have a distinctive style li blames the new competition rules that according to him place limitations on martial artists86 li believes that wushu is not primarily for selfdefense and instead of trying to play the hero people should think about peaceful resolutions of conflicts and call the police if necessary a gun outdoes years of martial arts training in a split second like ive said many times before it is important to differentiate between movies and reality the hero in movies may be able to knock the gun off his opponent and save the day but in real life probably that is not the case87 he has also stated that he has never had to use his martial arts skills in a reallife fight and he does not wish to either84 taiji zen in 2011 li founded taiji zen along with cofounder executive chairman jack ma taiji zen combined the martial art of tai chi taijiquan in chinese with practices such as meditation it packaged these into several different classes and online programs88 philanthropy li speaks at the world economic forum in tianjin china september 2008 li has been a philanthropic ambassador of the red cross society of china since january 2006 he contributed 500000 yuan us62500 of box office revenues from his film fearless to the red cross psychological sunshine project which promotes mental health89 in april 2007 touched by his lifeshaking experience in the maldives when he was close to dying during the 2004 tsunami li formed his own nonprofit foundation called one foundation9091 the one foundation supports international disaster relief efforts in conjunction with the red cross as well as other efforts including mental health awareness and suicide prevention since the starting of the foundation li has been involved with recovery efforts in seven disasters including the 2008 sichuan earthquake92 and typhoon morakot in taiwan93 in the 2013 lushan earthquake in yaan sichuan li and other members of the entertainment sector were the first to appeal for donations of money goods and materials to help the victims of the disaster9495 wu jing was a one foundation volunteer and helped in the effort96 li discussed his commitment to philanthropy in an interview with the december 2009 issue of alliance magazine stating that grassroots nongovernment organizations can help the government in its blind spots government relief is not always detailoriented grassroots ngos cant be as big as a government effort but they need to be flexible and independent97 in september 2010 he was appointed by the international red cross as the first good will ambassador he posted online saying today i signed a deal with the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies ifrc to become the first goodwill ambassador in the history of this humanitarian organization i am very honored at the same time i will not pause to celebrate but instead keep pushing forward and do my best to help the world thank you all once again for your support and belief in me98 it was also announced in september 2010 when li

gossipcop-871542,1,3 ways to get boho waves without heat i dont know about you but in the summer the last thing i want to do is style my hair with heat its just too hot to have more warmth radiating towards my head and melting off my makeup plus straightening my hair with a blow dryer or flat iron is a little pointless when the humidity is so high instead of fighting humid conditions i find its

commute to work if you dont have a lot of time in the morning to allow your hair to dry you can set it the night before and take it down in the morning technique 1 soft loose curls when it comes to wetsetting hair it makes sense to look at the techniques used before modern heat styling became available traditional pin curl sets produce a more structured curl but this simple arrangement yields a looser wave and takes only a few minutes to style supplies needed styling product i used redkin full frame mousse and white sands the cure 247 pin curl clips or duckbill clips step 1 apply product to damp hair and create a vertical section in the front above one ear this does not need to be perfectly sectioned in fact its better if its not perfectly straight to avoid part lines step 2 wrap the strand around your fingers away from your face to create a loop and wind the curl with your fingers down to your scalp step 3 slide a pin curl clip or duckbill clip in upwards from below to secure the strand in place the bottom prong should sit against your scalp and the top prong should be through the center of the curl step 4 continue taking vertical sections all the way from the crown to the

their divorce announcement fans couldnt help but wonder what went wrong brad pitt and angelina jolie brad pitt and angelina jolie got together shortly after his divorce from jennifer aniston which raised eyebrows among fans of the actress known first and foremost for her role as rachel green in friends it wasnt until years into their relationship that jolie 42 admitted that she and pitt had fallen in love on the set of mr mrs smith which they began filming in 2003 because of the film we ended up being brought together to do all these crazy things and i think we found this strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly happened i think a few months in i realized god i cant wait to get to workanything we had to do with each other we just found a lot of joy in it together and a lot of real teamwork we just became kind of a pair she revealed in an issue of vogue in case you all forgot brad pitt fell in love with another woman and begun a relationship with her while he was still married to jennifer aniston he left her to be with someone else why would anyone want her to get back together with him alina linagarcia february 16 2018 not many believed them but the pair always insisted they waited to get romantic with jolie telling the fashion magazine they were merely very very good friends until after pitt and aniston ended their marriage it took until really the end of the shoot for us i think to realize that it might mean something more than wed earlier allowed ourselves to believe and both knowing that the reality of that was a big thing something that was going to take a lot of serious consideration she said in 2005 pitt joined jolie on a trip to ethiopia to adopt her second child he formally adopted the little girl zahara and her older brother maddox in 2006 that same year he and jolie welcomed their first biological child together a daughter named shiloh jolie adopted son pax in 2007 with pitt adopting the child as his own in

angelinas kids jenniferaniston pictwittercomz60mxi2jb0 jerry don jerrydonut1 february 16 2018 the ceremony took place in their french chateau at the time jolie and pitt had been engaged for close to two years the pair previously said that they would not marry until it was legal for all people to be married we both have been married before so its not marriage thats necessarily kept some people together jolie told vogue we are legally bound to our children not to each other and i think thats the most important thing after 11 years together jolie and pitt shocked fans by announcing their divorce jolies attorney robert offer told ap that her decision to end the marriage was for the health of the family pitt fired back in a statement of his own which he released to people magazine in which he claimed he was saddened by the whole ordeal he went on to say that his focus at the time was on his children not long after they went public about their divorce reports surfaced suggesting that pitt was being investigated for child abuse linked to an incident on a private plane people reported that the los angeles police department and the la county department of children and family services was looking into an anonymous report that pitt had been verbally abusive and gotten physical with one of his children which later was revealed to be maddox the incident in question reportedly occurred on september 14 pitt is said to have been drinking at the time his entire family was present during the alleged altercation to the people feeling sorry 4 jenniferaniston she is

aniston about whether reconciliation is on the horizon though it has not stopped rampant speculation with one report even saying they were planning on making their debut as a couple at this years

been on the medication since high school and that she failed the wellness test because the paperwork to get permission to take this unnamed medication was not received by the wwe before she was tested

gossipcop-858987,1,review house of cards collapses finally this post contains plot details for the entirety of house of cards season 6 for a show built on the premise that people will abandon their values at the slightest hint of personal gain credit must be given to how swiftly house of cards offscreen handled the growing number of accusations of sexual misconduct against its star kevin spacey last year spacey has apologized to actor anthony rapp and sought treatment in the wake of further allegations production was suspended and a few days later spacey was fired season 6 was announced to be the shows last it was convenient that before spaceys firing season 5 of house of cards ended with robin wrights character claire underwood wresting control from her husband to become president of the united states herself my turn she says directly to the camera in one of the most successful finale twists the show has pulled off the flip became a moment of unexpected foreshadowing both for the direction of the show and for the nationwide conversation on the continued struggle for gender equality in season 6 all eight episodes of which debuted today claire is the president and frank is just a memorymuch discussed but never heard from or spoken to ever again house of cards wont even play his voice which becomes increasingly obvious as franks old voice memos become a soughtafter testament to claires awful character in the time line which picks up a couple of months after claires ascension frank is dead but we dont know how or why unfortunately thougheven with the leg up provided by the season 5 finale and the delayed releasethe production is unable to wrap up the story i dont even mean that house of cards doesnt end well although it doesnt i mean there are multiple story lines that are simply abandoned wright is excellentshes doing her best work in this season halfflirting with the audience as she scrambles to consolidate her position in the sense that house of cards transports the viewer to a fantasy of absolute destructive power wright offers a window into a female version of itone that is markedly more elegant as it is not suffused with spaceys overthetop southern drawl as the show has reiterated since its debut the power is still uglythrilling cathartic and fulfilling a very human desire yet still ugly but wright has inherited an impossible task the story is trying to wrap up five seasons of actionwhich includes the death of a halfdozen businesscasual flunkies and several layers of machiavellian manipulation the story of season 6 just doesnt cohere it barely even tracks well enough to summarize in a way the total breakdown is sort of beautiful its like watching the story collapse in upon itself a deserted building carefully demolished in exchange for a plot arc house of cards relies on what it has always done best cynical provocation the most confusing is claires canny exploitation of feminist language for political gain which in the back half of the season turns into a story about her inoffice pregnancy it is never made clear how claire gets pregnant presumably it could be her naturally conceived child with frank but the careful rollout of her condition suggests a much more calculated method wright puts a lot into the movement of her face but house of cards has very little to offer on claires feelings about impending motherhood or how being pregnant changes the environment of the white house midway through the season claire announces shes returning to her maiden name hale she also lectures the situation room during a nuclear crisis on how no one knows the word for the opposite of misogyny claire apparently was not paying much attention to the internet in like 2013 its not just claires story that spins out of control diane lane and greg kinnear play the billionaire shepherd siblings who are trying to use claire to their advantage and end up becoming her primary opponents a combination of the koch brothers and facebook their corporate holdings manage to mine data pollute the environment steal users privacy and uphold traditional family values but even though the siblings make for a fascinating if grotesque portrait of power privilege and traditional family values they barely have a story like so much else in this season the plot arc merely gestures toward relevance lanes character annette a friend of claires since girlhood provides a striking foil for claires ascent in one flashback to the dorms at andover the two are shown mirroring each other in elaborate cotillionstyle curtsies while sharing a bittenoff joint its a loaded arresting moment but its just that a moment the shepherds amass all of the notyetdead pawns from the last five seasons of house of cards on their teamjournalists working on hit pieces operativesturneddata miners russian plants in claires administration cabinet secretaries and supreme court justices that can be bought for the right price by the end of the season in what feels like a desperate attempt to tie up loose ends nearly all of these characters are killed the list includes patricia clarksons character jane boris mcgivers tom hammerschmidt and jayne atkinsons cathy durant who technically dies twice the shepherds get behind a supreme court ruling that would limit claires power so to outmaneuver them president hale dives into a heated conflict between ico the shows version of isis and russian president viktor petrov lars mikkelsen the shows version of vladimir putin this brings the nation to the brink of nuclear war and if this were not enough drama annette begins to coolly plan the presidents assassination with a cabal of coconspirators that includes the vice president campbell scott her man for the job doug stamper michael kelly frank underwoods longserving jackofalltrades which leads to the final scene of the entire series a faceoff between claire and doug in the oval office during which stamper confesses to murdering frank somewhat by accident by tampering with his medicationand then lunges at claire with franks letter opener claire adroitly turns it back on him and then as he bleeds suffocates him he does not resist so stamper dies in a pool of blood inches from the presidential seal on the carpet and clairealmost 30 weeks pregnant with an armed nuclear football awaiting her and political chaos loomingwhispers no more pain and then turns to the camera with an almost crazed look in her eye its a great shot the camera looks up at claire almost as if we are lying next to doug on the ground wrights blonde bob arcs toward the lens in a sweep but its a mysterious ambiguous ending for a show that has until now specialized in rather blunt storytelling with stamper dead is claire poised to succeed doomed to fail confident in her purpose haunted by guilt is this her last murder or a harbinger of future carnage what about everything elsethe press secretary who knew too much kristen sieh the fearmongering journalist athena karkanis the conniving speaker of the house boris kodjoe what about the data mining that exposed the midterms to fraud or the nuclear conflict in syria what about claires asyet unnamed daughter and annettes thwarted assassination attempt what about the story janine constance zimmer had worked for so long to report the story of house of cards took macbeth and machiavelli and unleashed it on the white house at its end all it can show the audience is a moment of interpersonal bloodlust

dress and up to the small of my back a warm hand hit the small of my back exhibit b exhibit c okay i could through a huge ass hissy fit fill this space with headdesk giffs and bash this book to tethers but i wonti wont because i pride myself in being a fair reviewer and because the author tried she went out there took her time wrote a book hired an editor got a publisher you get the drift the woman i presume gave it her all and i dont want to bash that instead my dearest goodreaders i will present to you the following evidence and leave you to decide what is fair and notsluts alpha malesyou know i have no issues with sluts i mean we all have the capacity to be sluts and im not berating our main character for being one im just stating that well she is a slutin a nut shellour female lead gwen had a one night stand with a guy one night and ever since then hes been coming back for more thats ok except she doenst know his name and knows nothing about him thats okay too whats not ok is that hein at night she doenst know how she doesnt know when all she knows isthats how he alerts her of his presence so basically this guy sneaks into her home wakes her up by putting his hand on her back has sex with her and fucks off nice nice the guy is obsessed with the small of her backi could go on its just so redundantanyways when they finally meet in the light of day this is better explained inwe discover that cabe haw delgade yes that is his name is a domineering bossy infurtiating alpha male by the end of the book we discover hes the way he is because his wife and daughter died in a tragic accident and he lost his marbles and became over protective fine i understand but that does not justify the following behaviour1 he thinks the best solution to deal with gwen is to manhandle her examplesgwen this relationship is overhawk pushes her up against the wall and holds her jaw in place its over when i say it isgwen having a bitch fit because someone just shot at herhawk pushes her up against the wall and holds her jaw in place calm downgwen get out of my house i dont want to see you anymorehawk hauls her to bedhugs her to him locks her with his legs go to sleep gwenwhy why i dont agree with characters like this i strongly dont agree with horny female characters either the only reason she stays with him is because when he manhandles her although she says shes angry she ends up kissing himhow can a guy push you around like that and then just kiss you and make it all better you see slut2 all the time they have been having an affair and she did not know his name he had his commandos following her around he knows what time she eats what time she sleeps who she hangs out with her parents history everything hes also got security cameras everywhere in her house stalker no according to gwen this means he cares awwin addition to all this sillines gwen is also attracted to 2 other guys she harps on and on about how she loves hawk then somehow ends up kissing the other 2 oopthiee fuck offplot failurei dont understand the side plot myself gwens step sister is a crack whore who stole money from some dangerous people but she also owes this biker gang which is headed by one of gwens love interests money and then there is her best friend another crack whore darla who wants to kill heri still dont know what hawk does but he has money to drive a

wife died gwens sister is a crack whore lawson the detective hawk and tankthe biker spend their time trying to protect gwen and make her love them a bunch of kidnappings occur and finally obviously gwen and hawk hook up and everyone in the book stays friends forevergrammar nazieveryone called each other babe hawk to gwen gwen to hawk gwen to her friends her friends to each other gwen to lawson lawson to gwen gwens mom to gwen gwen to her crack whore sister which amounted to babebaby being repeated as if that wasnt bad enough the author felt the need to be creative and bombarded us withhoney 45 timessweet pea 70 timespeaches 19 timesfor some reason all the characters had the grammar and vocabulary skills of a gangster who dropped out of school in the 5th grade while gwen graced us with the word um 71 timesseventy one timesnough saidyou know why i got angry because i love mindless chick flicks and i was willing to forgo so maanny of the above in fact the first few chapters had me rolling on the ground with laughter then bam slamming to walls and manhandling occurs and that is just not my peice of cakeall i can say isthis is your fault christian grey

politifact9802,1,senator rand paul on ferguson we must demilitarize the police jeff robersonap anyone who thinks that race does not skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention and the root of the problem is big government the shooting of 18yearold michael brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of ferguson missouri and across the nation if i had been told to get out of the street as a teenager there would have been a distinct possibility that i might have smarted off but i wouldnt have expected to be shot the outrage in ferguson is understandablethough there is never an excuse for rioting or looting there is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response the images and scenes we continue to see in ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action glenn reynolds in popular mechanics recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago in 2009 he wrote soldiers and police are supposed to be different police look inward theyre supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals and to maintain order with a minimum of force its the difference between audie murphy and andy griffith but nowadays police are looking and acting more like soldiers than cops with bad consequences and those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians the cato institutes walter olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in ferguson why armored vehicles in a midwestern inner suburb why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors why are the authorities in ferguson mo so given to quasimartial crowd control methods such as bans on walking on the street and per the reporting of riverfront times the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards this my property he shouted prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd airborne army veteran observing the ferguson police scene comment that we rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone olson added the dominant visual aspect of the story however has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands how did this happen most police officers are good cops and good people it is an unquestionably difficult job especially in the current circumstances there is a systemic problem with todays law enforcement not surprisingly big government has been at the heart of the problem washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armieswhere police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of americans think of as law enforcement this is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism the heritage foundations evan bernick wrote in 2013 that the department of homeland security has handed out antiterrorism grants to cities and towns across the country enabling them to buy armored vehicles guns armor aircraft and other equipment bernick continued federal agencies of all stripes as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14000 come equipped with swat teams and heavy artillery bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve today bossier parish louisiana has a 50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle the pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the countrytanks included when you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jurynational security letters noknock searches broad general warrants preconviction forfeiturewe begin to have a very serious problem on our hands given these developments it is almost impossible for many americans not to feel like their government is targeting them given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system it is impossible for africanamericans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them this is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of st louis missouri it is what the citizens of ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with michael brown anyone who thinks that race does not still even if inadvertently skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for nonviolent mistakes in their youth the militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm it is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime it is quite another for them to subsidize it americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous or false security this has been a cause i have championed for years and one that is at a nearcrisis point in our country let us continue to pray for michael browns family the people of ferguson police and citizens alike paul is the junior us senator for

gossipcop-849801,1,today in entertainment cnn fires kathy griffin over gory trump photo lebanon officially bans wonder woman happy puking baywatch is the summer blockbuster critics love to hate dwayne johnson zac efron and priyanka chopra star in baywatch whats more fun than seeing the new baywatch movie having movie reviewers see it for you los angeles times critic jen yamato was in the enjoy it for what it is camp describing the film thusly it not only owns its dumbness but hurtles itself all the way back around through a flurry of genitalia jokes and fbombs to splash unapologetically in an rrated surf of winking postmodernism led by the charismatic dwayne johnson hollywoods most unsinkable movie star but although not everyone hates it 64 of audiences dug it according to rotten tomatoes a lot of reviewers put the bouncingbeachbodies flick firmly in its place damning it and then damning it with faint praise that said here are a few snacks both bad and relatively good from the baywatch snark buffet over at the chicago tribune they took the yeah and approach to the review the bad the movies comic instincts are consistently coarse and frequently scrotal the good the bodies on screen are pretty which i seem to remember was a selling point of the 19892001 tv series as we said yeah and the roger ebert website perhaps cut closest to the bone pulling few punches the bad this is another one of those raunchy comedies thats barely a movie that looks like it was edited by dumping a bunch of footage into whatever moviecutting software theyre using and hitting randomize the good the movie has a pervading air of crass amiability about it its almost like a twohour endcredits gag reel nevertheless it contains an end credits gag reel now could you tell us what you really think rolling stone painted a vivid picture of the baywatch experience the bad think of yourself sitting down for a big twohour wallow in instant stupid with a vat of popcorn slathered in fake butter and possibly a mound of melted mms on top it feels great chugging it down then your stomach hurts your head aches and you puke the whole thing up so you can forget about it in the morning thats baywatch in a nutshell happy puking the good of the recent spate of moldy tv material morphing into movies with 21 jump street on top and chips bringing up the rear baywatch barely escapes the basement one reason it does the rock helpful turns out if you liked 21 jump street and chips this flick is for you the new york times loosened up its necktie for this one the bad the digital effects fire and water mostly are lackluster and the whole thing has a crummy overcast secondratethemepark look to it the good like its source material baywatch is sleazy and wholesome silly and earnest dumb as a box of sand and slyly selfaware its softserve ice cream crinklecut fries a hot car and a skin rash tacky and phony and nasty and also kind of fun tacky phony nasty we didnt know it was a date movie the washington post of course just couldnt leave politics out of it the bad its no shock that the women in baywatch dont have much to do beyond look good maybe dodging bad lines was a relief for the actresses its not like the screenplay by damian shannon and mark swift gives performers a lot to work with the good if indeed dwayne the rock johnson ditches hollywood to become our next commander in chief baywatch may be singled out as the low point of his prepolitical career well at least johnson has that out of the way the tampa bay times went deadpan the bad imagining johnson and genetically gifted costars in swimsuits is all it took to pitch baywatch director seth gordon and six writers didnt come up with much beyond that the good what baywatch has in its favor is dwayne johnson firemancarrying a dead weight comedy to safety we think thats a compliment maybe variety noted the films nods to current market and societal trends the bad baywatch is a stupidly entertaining trash folly the kind that could only be made today an obscenityandinsultlaced aggressively competent adaptation of a 25yearold tv show that manages to repackage every aspect of the series except perhaps the reason it was popular in the first place the good they wear their butthugging red bathing suits with dignity and pride which makes this a highly sexually responsible baywatch the reviewer at the new york post appeared to be familiar with the tv series global success the bad even the action scenes need cpr often undermined by effects so chintzy you wonder if the money intended for them was instead eaten up by the productions sevenfigure waxing budget the good on the bright side itll probably do killer business in germany wait were they just dissing the hoff finally one need go no further than the av club to understand rotten tomatoes 19 positive critics rating the bad nobody not even the filmmakers cares about baywatch all that much yet the jokes on them in spoofing something so

gossipcop-1852746781,0,whats up with nicole kidman even by hollywood standards she has always been slender but with her size six trousers hanging loose over her hips and not even the hint of a curve where once there was a perfectly sculpted alabaster cleavage it is clear that nicole kidman has lost a disturbing amount of weight emerging from a yoga class in new york the 36yearold actress looked skinnier than she has ever been associates say that at 5ft 10in she weighs only 8st 3lb several friends are concerned that she is dieting and exercising more than is healthy and others wonder what can be behind the change one old friend who remarked after embracing her recently that she was nothing but skin and bone was told with a wan smile perhaps i have been overdoing it a little she certainly takes vigorous exercise exercising more than is healthy as well as her regular yoga classes near her rented penthouse in the soho district she swims and jogs often recently she was seen jogging in a tracksuit hat and gloves in a temperature of 30c although her defenders say they have seen her dining on sea bass or tucking in to chocolate ice cream there are allegedly times when she prefers vegetable smoothies to a meal currently her body mass index expressing weight in relation to height stands at just 16 the healthy range is 20 to 25 and doctors become concerned if it drops below 18 she is then clinically underweight because she is so tall the loss of 15lb since her marriage to tom cruise ended twoandahalf years ago is clearly apparent her agents however talked last night about her being happy and healthy and vigorously denied any suggestions of an eating disorder catherine olim her spokesman said nicole has always been slender look at american vogue she is glorious i dont know what the fuss is about those protests are given credibility by a 40page spread in the magazine she refers to which hit newsstands this week but valentino says her figure is perfect miss kidman looks stunning posing in clothes by a string of designers she has the most perfect figure coos valentino her influence in the fashion world is so great that she is shortly to be unveiled as the international face of chanel no 5 perfume in media terms she has blossomed since splitting from cruise it is fair to say that she has never been in such demand but the question many are asking is why nicole who has relocated to new york with her two adopted children conor and isabella is looking so tired and nervy and why they are wondering in italy has she pulled out of the venice film festival and why they wonder in hollywood has she turned down a 10million payday the biggest of her career to star in a film opposite brad pitt there are signs that nicole who said in the spring that she feared a burnout is under a considerable amount of pressure both emotional and professional she is still alone despite a fling with rap star qtip and a flirtation with rock star lenny kravitz from whom she is renting a penthouse while her own pad in the city is renovated her romantic friendship with russell crowe has foundered and he has now married his onoff girlfriend danielle who is expecting a baby how painful this must be for nicole who longs to have a baby herself overwhelmed with grief after miscarriage she was by her own admission almost overwhelmed by grief when she had a miscarriage only six weeks after her marriage to cruise ended those who know her best say that she is still puzzling over the wreckage of that marriage and trying to come to terms with the feelings of abandonment and rejection which resulted i dont think two people could have been happier than tom and i she mused i was desperate to have a baby with tom he swept me off my feet and i fell madly passionately in love i was consumed by it and i was desperate to have a baby with him thats what i wish id done her vulnerable state of mind is not helped by a recurrence of the insomnia which has plagued her for much of her adult life furthermore she has been driven to the brink by film roles about rejected depressed and oppressed women with whom she identifies to a remarkable extent in an interview she said that she hesitated to play the suicidal virginia woolf in the hours because she feared the effect on her own state of mind i wasnt sure i could go through with it virginia woolfs unhappiness was just too similar to my own hesitated to play suicidal virginia woolf i was afraid to do it because i thought it would be too painful she said but i think characters come into your life sometimes because theyre meant to i was able to use her and her knowledge there are signs that she is no less troubled currently on the set of stepford wives in new york the crew are said to be muttering about delays because she does not want to film outside in strong sunshine her representatives say this is utter nonsense no one is more professional than nicole they aver sternly but whatever the truth of those reports one does wonder whether the film a remake of the seventies classic about a town where wives are replaced by compliant domestic robots has uncomfortable resonances for nicole whose catholic beliefs were put aside by her scientologist husband and who during her marriage lost her identity in his what she yearns for is love the love she gave to cruise and which she still feels for him she yearns for love ive said to tom i will be there for him for the rest of his life always she said earlier this year tom and i had 11 years together your heart has to stay loving she surprised everyone by admitting at the cannes film festival that she would give up her career for love i wont do this for the rest of my life theres other things that interest me she said i think when i fall in love ill stop doing as much of this because i want to settle down again what she has experienced since then though are little more than dangerous flirtations qtip her escort at the premiere of the hours appeared to have been chosen because he is as unlike her former husband as it is possible to be kravitz meanwhile took her to puff daddys birthday party again an event which would be anathema to straitlaced cruise in private nicole talks a great deal about concentrating on her children and trying to make it up to them she feels immensely guilty about the divorce she also complains that she would like to find a man with whom she could have an intelligent conversation she is unhappily single the jude law episode when she was falsely accused of breaking up his marriage was bruising and she felt humiliated that anyone would think she would steal another womans husband their meetings on both sides of the atlantic were professional in short she remains steadfastly but unhappily single what a pity for this is surely the golden period in nicoles professional life she took the best actress oscar this spring for the hours later this year cold mountain the civil war epic directed by anthony minghella will be released and there is already an oscar buzz forming about this bleak film also later this year she will be seen in the human stain opposite sir anthony hopkins then there is birth a film about a grieving widow which she made early this year and after that stepford wives scheduled for release next year because of delays in filming stepford wives she has had to pull out of the venice film festival and because of the promotional schedule of cold mountain she has had to pull out of mr and mrs smith opposite pitt her diary is indeed creaking at the seams and she is determined to make the most of her status while she can despite the insecurity which leads her sometimes to fear taking on projects in case she is not good enough there was a time when part of me didnt really want to take on too many projects because i had other priorities like my marriage and my family she said earlier this year now i feel more confident also i find with two children that are older that allows me a bit more time to devote to making films they dont need you every five minutes and they spend time with their father in any case im a pragmatist and i wont always be offered these opportunities work while you can i say she is living very much the burnout life which she described in cannes this year travelling constantly and working hard burnout lifestyle you give so much of yourself and youve got to step away at some stage you cant do it for ever she said could it be that the worryingly slight figure that emerged this week is evidence she is reaching the point of no return

chiefs of staff general richard myers former pow now republican senator from arizona john mccain and the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee joe biden of delaware then the very latest on the california recall and the race for the democratic presidential nomination insights and analysis from ron brownstein of the los angeles times and roger simon of us news world report but first we are joined by the nations top military leader general richard myers welcome gen richard myers thanks tim mr russert as we showed in our leadin on may 1st the president said mission accomplished in iraq since that time 135 american soldiers have been killed was that too premature of an announcement gen myers i think what the president said was major combat operations are over and he also went on to say theres a lot of hard work left to do both in afghanistan and iraq so i think he was talking about the major combat operations mr russert we will not need any more major significant combat operations in iraq gen myers well the way we look at it now no were dealing with the remnants of the regime former regime loyalists some outside foreign fighters jihaddists who are coming there to fight and ill tell you why theyre coming there because the stakes are so high in iraq this war on terrorism that weve been about now for almost two years strikes at the very heart of what we believe and what many countries in this believe in terms of our core values of peace and liberty and the opportunity to share in prosperity and thats what its all about in iraq thats what its about in afghanistan and thats why theyre coming there to fight mr russert when you were on this program and other places in march you said that the most important objective was to disarm iraq of its weapons of mass destruction have we found any yet gen myers that work is ongoing weve got over 1000 people in an intelligence cell over there working under some really great leadership and theyll reveal what they found at the appropriate time but theyre continuing to run that down i think i also said that this is difficult iraqs the size of the state of california the other day we saw them dig up one of the buried fighter aircraft they went to extraordinary lengths to bury an aircraft a 55gallon drum with anthrax in it would be a lot more difficult to find and dig up so itll work i mean the system we have in place the process we have in place will work and well find what we are after mr russert and youll find weapons of mass destruction gen myers thats my view mr russert was the imminence of the threat of those weapons overstated gen myers no i dont think so i think any prudent military planner would have to take into account the fact that they had programs i mean the world knew that the iraqi regime had weapons of mass destruction thats why we went into combat in our protective gear even as hot as it was the gear just makes it even that much worse so no that was a very prudent thing to do and we had lots of intelligence that said that we could be subjected to weapons of mass destruction mr russert is saddam hussein still in iraq gen myers best we know he is and again if we dont have him we dont know exactly where he is or whether hes dead or alive i think most people think hes alive and were closing in on him like were closing in on all of the top 55 let me just tell you weve already got 42 of the top 55 the deck of cards if you will weve got 42 of them obviously saddam hussein is an important part of that but hes not the only part and were making great progress mr russert but capturing 42 of the 55 hasnt stopped the resistance will capturing saddam stop the resistance gen myers oh i think its just one more step in what we have to do and i dont personally believe that the resistance will stop because you get saddam hussein i think some of the wind will be taken out of the sails of those who think that theres some slim hope that this regime will come back its not coming back it never will come back whether we get saddam or not is not going to change that but it will be help i think itll help in terms of peoples perception mr russert on tuesday as we all know the un headquarters in iraq was bombed the new york times wrote this story american investigators looking into the suicide bombing of the united nations compound on tuesday are focusing on the possibility that the attackers were assisted by iraqi security guards who worked there a senior american official here said the official said all of the guards at the compound were agents of the iraqi secret services to whom they reported on united nations activities before the war the united nations continued to employ them after the war was over the official said we believe the uns security was seriously compromised the official said adding that we have serious concerns about the placement of the vehicle and the timing of the attack was this an inside job gen myers i dont think we know yet its only a few days since the attack i think we need to let the investigation run its course and well find out mr russert theres a lot of discussion about iraq becoming a mecca for terrorists a haven for terrorists now porous borders which prompted jessica stern to write an oped piece which said this tuesdays bombing of the united nations headquarters in baghdad was the latest evidence that america has taken a country that was not a terrorist threat and turned it into one america has created not through malevolence but through negligence precisely the situation the bush administration has described as a breeding ground for terrorists a state unable to control its borders or provide for its citizens rudimentary needs gen myers clearly iraq before march 19 before we went across the border was a terrorist state supported terrorism and had a weapons of mass destruction program and what mr russert whats the evidence of that general gen myers well the evidence was before we went over the many un security council resolutions that stated that they had a program and that they had weapons of mass destruction they had not accounted for they were supporting hamas and other terrorist organizations if you remember saddam hussein was paying i think it was 25000 to families of terrorists who would conduct suicide attacks to the families of those who would conduct suicide attacks against israel and of course there was this group of ansar alislam up in northeast iraq that was working on poisons that had actually in fact infiltrated into europe and some of those plots thwarted by the british and the french and others so i mean this was a very very bad regime the hope for iraq is what were doing right now the hope for iraq is what were doing right now and it is a highstakes game because this is about the war on terrorism its exactly about that and now the countries that surround iraq need to be cooperative need to help control their borders so more foreign fighters dont come into iraq mr russert but have we created a haven a mecca for terrorists around the world to congregate and to use as a base to strike at 150000 americans on the ground gen myers no i dont think weve created a mecca i think what a lot of foreign fighters want to do is that they see this as a very important venue for them to oust the americans the coalition the international community we have over 40 countries involved in this and another 14 that look like theyre going to probably put troops into iraq so this is an international effort you saw what they did to the un its clearly an international effort and what the terrorists want to do is they want to have their way they want to win and if they can win in iraq they feel that they can get the international community out of the middle east and let terrorism have its way and thats just not going to be its more a question of wills right now mr russert so this is now more than just toppling saddam hussein this has become the big magilla in terms of defeating world terrorism gen myers well i think its part of the war on terrorism weve said that all along and i dont know if its the big magilla but its a very important part of it and you know if we can help iraq become a free democratic country that recognizes and treats its minorities and ethnic groups appropriately that is respectful of its borders then weve done a very wonderful thing in the middle east and im not saying we the united states im saying we the international community thats what the un was all about and by the way theyre obviously there to stay because theyve stood back up again as you saw theyre in tents and theyre operating again in baghdad mr russert you mentioned the international troops would you be willing to allow the united nations to assume some portion of control of the occupation in order to bring in the french and the british and significant amounts of international forces gen myers that is obviously an issue for the diplomats and the political leadership i think it is important that this effort be internationalized and as i mentioned earlier it has been internationalized weve got in fact 35 countries with troops on the ground as i mentioned another 14 that are contemplating that other countries that are providing help in many other ways financial and mr russert but we have 150000 american troops and about 20000 international troops gen myers thats correct and were looking for a third multinational division absolutely mr russert let me turn to the issue of troops this is what some of the experts have had to say and ill show you and our viewers some experts say it is unrealistic to think that iraq can be secured with troops at the current level a debate over this subject flared in may when gen eric k shinseki then the army chief of staff said hundreds of thousands would be needed to secure iraq after the war james f dobbins an expert in peacekeeping operations who was the bush administrations special envoy to afghanistan said in an interview today that the united states might need 300000 to 500000 troops to maintain stability in the country whatever the right number is its significantly larger than what we have said mr dobbins director of international security and defense policy at the rand corporation do you agree gen myers no i dont agree and first of all its a complex security environment inside iraq i was just there several weeks ago i went to the heart of where 80 percent or more of the incidents occurred north of baghdad and between baghdad and tikrit i was in tikrit the technical difficulties i rely and secretary rumsfeld relies president bush relies on the combatant commander general john abizaid to give us his assessment of what he needs if he wants more troops he can have more troops that is never an issue but thats not what general abizaid is asking for thats not what his division commanders are asking for and you have to take in account that we have over 50000 iraqis now that have been trained over time 50000 that are armed and working with us to bring security and stability to that country that number will continue to grow and dramatically between now and next month and the month after and then we have the international community helping as well so it is complex its not the same all over the country and number of troops wont help with those random acts of violence that we have from time to time its not just always a matter of troops so i rely on the ground combatant commander and thats general abizaid mr russert but if we continue to lose american soldiers youd be open to sending more american troops to iraq gen myers if the ground commandersif general abizaid says he wants more troops then sure well be open to that you bet mr russert and general barry mccaffrey has said we just dont have them to send the cover of time magazine are we stretched too thin do we have more troops available to send to iraq gen myers we do we aretwo things we are stretched thin but we have more troops we have more troops to send we have other ways to do that and we can take those steps but mr russert call up more reserves if necessary gen myers well the reserves are going to be part of whatever we do in the future anyway thats just the way we are you know lets go back and step back just a second and say what this is all about we are a nation at war this is a war against international terrorism in my view this is the biggest threat to this countrys existence as far back as i can remember at least to world war ii perhaps eyond because theyre striking at the very things that we hold dear our core values and its not just true for the united states its true as we see in riyadh as we saw in bali as we see in jakarta around the world terrorists are trying to strike fearterrorinto the hearts of people so they can have their way with the processes that we hold so dear and so its important that we remember that as we go afterand so were willing toits going to require sacrifice and commitment our troops understand that their families understand that our job is to try to make their lives as predictable to provide the resources to do the job and were committed to do that mr russert might we have to reconstitute the draft gen myers oh i thinkno no i cant say that were anywhere close to that at this point mr russert as you know secretary rumsfeld asked a group of civilians to go over and take a look at what is going on in iraq the socalled hamry report right here which ill put on the screen they concluded this the iraqi population has exceedingly high expectations and the window for cooperation may close rapidly if they do not see progress on delivering security basic services opportunities for broad political involvement and economic opportunity that was a month ago gen myers you bet mr russert and it appears the situation has worsened since then gen myers first of all a great report by dr hamry they did a very nice job and theyre right in the sense that to provide the iraqis the opportunity for freedom and prosperity that they can have in that very rich countryrich in oil rich in water rich in human resourcesyou need security you need economic progress you need political progress and things are happening on all three fronts and we look every dayand i wont speak for ambassador bremer but we look every day at ways to improve that and there areyou know the coalition inherited an infrastructure that was very dilapidated the hospital i visited in baghdad hadnt had any upgrades in 50 years while saddams building palaces he didnt upgrade the hospitals so you know we have to start in some cases from the ground up mr russert but is the window of opportunity closing quickly where we may lose the iraqi people as they become frustrated without power without selfgovernance and with a larger terrorist threat gen myers i think we need to put maximum effort on those piecesthe economic piece the political piece the infrastructure piecethat i mentioned so we dont lose them but i dont think were in danger of doing that right now in fact the soldiers i talked to up near tikrit and more specifically near balad said listen we know were having an effect on this country because tens upon tens of people come out and tell us when were on patrol thank you very much for being here thank you for being here that story is not going to get in the front page but it is in fact what goes on in the majority of places in iraq mr russert tom friedman of the new york times made this observation in his column and ill share with you and our viewers anyone familiar with nato operations in bosnia and kosovo should have understood that we needed two armies for this invasion the first was the fighting force that would kill saddams regime and the second following right behind it a force of military police civilian affairs officers aid groups and public affairs teams to get our message across the pentagon brilliantly prepared the first force but not the second gen myers and were working hard on that second force i will remind you that when general franks tookwent across the border in kuwait into iraq that in fact we did have civil affairs people with right us we had humanitarian rations we had water and we had engineers to help fix the infrastructure so it was always part of the plan and we continue to work that that isits extremely important piece cannot be underestimated and mr russert but in all honesty did you misjudge the level of resistance gen myers i think the diehards in the iraqi regime the former regime loyalists as we now talk about them i think theyve been probably a little more active than we thought but then you know its alsotheres this big criminal element and how didhow were they going to behave the 300000 criminals that were let out of the iraqi jails by saddams regime before the fighting started i mean we have to deal with those too how many of these incidents are criminal as opposed to former regime loyalists and so you know its hard to answer its a complex security situation but its hard to answer that question right mr russert but this is going to take lots of time lots of money and lots of manpower gen myers its going to take more than anything else both in afghanistan and iraq patience by the american people and an understanding that this is a very very important fight in both those places and not just the american people but the international community afghanistan did not get the way it is now in a day it took decades of mismanagement and brutal regimes iraq didnt get the way it was with this dilapidated infrastructure and the fear of the people to come out and participate in their government in a day so its going to take patience to get this job done youre absolutely right and its going to take money not necessarily us money but international money certainly us will be a part of that mr russert right now its primarily us money gen myers well theres lots of ways to get resources and revenues for that and theres a donors conference i think coming up in october to work more of that for iraq and this is an important fight for the international community and everybody needs to step up mr russert general richard myers we thank you for your views gen myers thank you very much mr russert coming next the view from the us senate with two key members who made recent trips to baghdad john mccain and joe biden they will be together right here on meet the press republican mccain democrat biden coming up announcements mr russert senators john mccain and joe biden on iraq our political roundtable and the california recall and who will be the democratic nominee after this station break announcements mr russert and we are back senators welcome both senator mccain youre in turkey let me start with you what must be done in iraq right now sen john mccain raz first could i say tim the men and women in the military are doing a superb job to see these young people in 125degree heat with body armor and equipment on theyre marvelous and theyre wellled and theyre doing a great job the problem is that they dont have enough resources theres not enough of them and we are in a very serious situation in my view a race against time we need to spend a whole lot more money to get the services back to the people we need to get the electricity going the fuel the water and unless we get that done and get it done pretty soon we could face a very situation mr russert how many more troops do you think we need in iraq sen mccain i think we need i would guess at least another division but we also need people with specialized skills linguists were running short of our guard and reservists are at the breaking point we need civil affairs people the refinery at basra cannot be fixed it needs to be totally replaced it was 30 years of neglect on the part of the saddam hussein regime mr russert senator biden sen joe biden dde i fully agree with john you know im like a broken record on this tim we are woefully under prepared i think this administration mr rumsfeld they should sort of get over it and get to what they seem unwilling to do this is like ideologies run into reality here we need more troops we need more cops we need more civilian affairs people we were woefully unprepared but we have incredible people there now they dont have the resources we dont even have a communication system johns over there now turn on the television what youll find isits likeno one watching we control the media over there we dont have it up and running in the way that has any credibility i mean theres no sense of urgency here with this administration now and its time for the president to go to the american people and say look this is a gigantic undertaking its going to cost billions of dollars and take more force in order to do it so were about to lose the american people forget losing the iraqis we are going to lose the american peoples support for this undertaking unless he starts to level with them mr russert how many more troops do we need sen biden well i understand from the experts i speak to 40000 to 60000 additional troops and in order to get those we need a un resolution authorizing them we dont have to have these folks under blue helmets they can be under us command kofi annan as recently as two days ago said he saw how that could work but weve got to sort of swallow our pride and do whats supposed to be done go back to the international community look we squandered two opportunities tim we squandered the first opportunity when we went in by not bringing along the rest of the world with us right after we went in the president landed on an aircraft carrier and said mission accomplished when that banner should have said weve only just begun and he should have turned to the rest of the world and said now come in we need you this is a third opportunity that came from the bombing something bad happened something good can come from it if we lead nowleadand we have to lead the rest of the world into putting incredible resources into iraq now to get it up and running mr russert senator mccain general barry mccaffrey said this the other day counting 10000 troops in afghanistan 37000 in korea more than half the army in iraq we cant do any more we have three brigades uncommitted and reserved and we have other international responsibilities the real question is does the administration right now have the political will to call up maybe nine national guard brigades and tell them theyre on duty for 12 months and add them to the force structure if we dont do that a year from now we are going over a cliff do you agree with that sen mccain i dont have the kind of knowledge that general mccaffrey and others have about the specifics of the number of troops i know we need more i know we need them particularly in certain specialties people have said in the guard and reserves time is up and they have to be replaced but i want to mention one other thing real quick and thats this business of all these outside people coming in from saudi arabia syria iran they are coming in because they know whats at stake and we cannot afford to lose this but if we win the hearts and mindsand i hate to use that phrase because it reminds us of time long agobut if we can win the people over then these people will be treated as the outsiders that they are chairman mao said the guerrilla is to the people as the fish is to water we can dry up the water so im worried about those people coming from outside but im far more worried about the people of iraq losing confidence they dont understand when the economy of kuwait was restored in six months that we havent done a much better job and its a very difficult tough job and yes the president has to tell the american people its tough and im sure the american people will support him when they know whats at stake mr russert let me show you what a newsweek poll out this morning says if attacks continue on us military personnel would you support a withdrawal of us troops from iraq yes 48 percent no 47 and would you support increasing the number of us troops in iraq yes 40 percent no 55 percent and this do you support current us spending levels in iraq yes 34 percent no reduce spending 60 percent senator biden how do you respond to that sen biden you know last time i was on your show tim the thing we talked about was the hamry report and how the window was closing and you and i talked about how the window thats closing is support of the american people and theres three things that the american people have to understand and they havent been told by the president and that is this is going to cost us hundreds of billions of dollars over time were spending 4 billion a month just to keep our troops there and theres not even a penny put into next years budget the administration hasnt even budgeted one penny for it yet its almost like we want to keep this a secret if the american people know whats at stake and what is at stake is not only this war on terror by the way if get iraq right theres still going to be terror but if we get iraq wrong the entirety of the middle east is going to become a cauldron for the next decade and so we have much at stake here and the president has to go and explain to the american people in order to turn around those numbers why this is important he hasnt given a rationale yet he should go on prime time and say the is what needs to be done this is what im asking of you and this is what we need and this is how well succeed well get american support if we do that but no wonder they have those poll numbers now all they see is chaos and no explanation from the president except terror mr russert senator mccain half the country said we should withdraw us troops 55 percent say dont send more american troops and 60 percent say we should reduce spending in iraq what should the president do sen mccain speak directly to the american people the american people have great confidence in the president he led this nation with great moral clarity after september 3rd speak directly to the american people and the american people fully would understand that we cannot protect our own borders we have to go where the terrorists are if they win here then obviously we cannot win the war on terrorism and the dictators in this part of the world are paying attention as well as the terrorist organizations we can and will win these are the best fighting men and women in the world and if theyre given the equipment and the wherewithal theyll do it and the american people will support them mr russert senator biden the whole notion of iraq becoming a haven for worldwide terrorism almost a haven if you will for people to come who want to participate in the jihadhas the situation worsened or improved since the war sen biden well i dont think it matters a lot quite frankly in other words were there were attracting these people but we did not by going in create this haven for terror what we did by going in is we created a gigantic target and we havent provided enough security to protect the target look were getting95 percent of the deaths are americans 95 percent of the money is american money 95 percent of the troops are american troops one of two things happensone of three things either we lose iraq by pulling out we dont put more troops in two we put more of our troops in increasing more money more deaths more involvement or we get other people in how do we get other people in we have to have a un resolution thats the only way turkey and these other countries say theyll go in under the umbrella of a un resolution so i dont know why we dont get on with it its simple tim we do it all by ourselves or we get the rest of the international community to help us do it its that simple this is not rocket science this is not complicated we pay the whole bill like were paying nowand by the way all these other 10 20 30 nations theyre contributing an average 400 troops per nation give me a break theres nothing international about this until we get nato in there and we get islamic forces in there and we can get 30000 islamic forces in there from pakistan and from turkey and we can also get india in on the deal now which would make a gigantic difference now allowing us to free up our forces doing police work to concentrate on the borders and to concentrate on the tough areas but we dont seem to be willing to acknowledge this what is the hangup here whats the hangup we either pay for it allthis administrations treating iraq like its some prize we won that we dont want to share mr russert how long realistically will we be in iraq and at what cost sen biden the cost will be well over several hundred billion dollars over time mr russert hundred sen biden hundreds of billions were already spending 4 billion a month we spent 60 billion going in mr russert youre talking years sen biden im talking years we saidi said to you on this program over a year ago its going to be somewhere between three and five years were in there the hope was we would be in there with a whole lot of other people tim so we are notyou know its likeif the american flag is the only thing seen there as an occupying force thats just what we are viewed as but if you have a truly multinational force in there with multinational responsibility you will get the consent of the people of iraq as well as the region to understand that this is not an occupation this is a liberation its kind of like a seesaw theres a tipping point here were going to hit some mr russert but what if the other countries the french the germans say no sen biden well they will saythey will come in if we ask and if we go into it by providing for them to have some say in the political side of this equation mr russert shared authority sen biden shared authority not shared authoritylook no ones saying that you should have anything other than an american commander running all the forces there but shared authority in determining what that governments going to look like and by the way why wouldnt we want that why would we not want that i dont get this i dont get it mr russert senator mccain realistically how long will american troops be in iraq and how much is it going to cost us sen mccain i dont know the answer to that but im telling you what the question is and the critical aspect of this is what happens in the next few months sen biden exactly sen mccain time is not on our side people in 125degree heat with no electricity and no fuel are going to become angry in a big hurry the sophistication of the attacks on us and allied troops have increased and what we do in the next several months will determine whether were in a very difficult situation or not and theres still time but weve got to act quickly mr russert so you are urging the president to move in tens of thousands more american troops quickly senator mccain sen mccain and a lot of money the money has got to flow we have to get these oil pipelines repaired we have got to get the water flowing we have got to get the fundamental services and as importantly we have got to turn the government of iraq over to the iraqi people as quickly as possible we have done that in places like kirkuk that i visited and we can do it in other places but its going to be very tough but we have got to let the iraqi people govern themselves as quickly as possible mr russert do they have a security force in place that can in fact do that sen mccain not at the moment no i dont believeweve got a great deal more to do and again its not so much numbers its specialities and skills andcivil affairs military police linguists were very short of people that speak the languages so its not only just numbers its the skills they bring and our guard and reserve people are very very overstretched mr russert will you say this to the president directly senator mccain sen mccain sure ive never been reluctant in the past and he and i have had good conversations and im sure we will on this mr russert senator biden how acute is this sen biden you know its like you got a veinyou know your artery youre losing blood we need a tourniquet on it immediately and thats what johns talking about in my view immediately whatever it takes for example we were talking about a month ago tim everybody says we need 5800 european police forces in there right now we dont have them in there we havent made this a primary overwhelming objective once we stop that bleeding then we can stitch up the wound thats going to take the longest thats the international community but in the meantime we got to staunch this bleeding mr russert couldnt be more serious senator mccain before you go in our next segment were going to talk about california as a republican what kind of governor do you think arnold schwarzenegger would make sen mccain i think that he will probably make a fine governor i have never had the opportunity of seeing him but i have always admired his skills in the movies mr russert john mccain that has to be the last word joe biden thanks very much coming next governor gray davis blames a republican conspiracy on his troubles arnold meets the press and cruz bustamante lieutenant governor calls for tough love the california recall just six weeks away insights and analysis from roger simon of us news world report and ron brownstein of the los angeles times with new poll numbers out this morning coming up on meet the press announcements mr russert and we are back roger ron welcome california recall mr roger simon thank you mr ron brownstein tim yeah mr russert california recallron your paper the los angeles times out this morning with a new poll should gray davis the governor be recalled and here are the numbers yes 50 percent no 45 percent you need 501 percent for a recall whats going on mr brownstein well gray davis has had some success at what was job one for him which was bringing back democrats in the earlier polling when hethe recall was doing better he was losing as much as 35 to 40 percent of democrats to voting yes on the recall in our poll 34 of democrats now say they oppose the recall in california i think it was only 15 percent of democrats were now supporting it davis went out this week with a very partisan argument he called it part of a rightwing power grab said it was part of an ongoing republican effort to steal elections some people said that was too hot and divisive but it did seem to have its immediate intended effect of rallying democrats at least temporarily to his cause mr russert lets listen to governor gray davis in his own words this is exactly as ron described them videotape august 19 2003 gov gray davis dca whats happening here is part of an ongoing national effort to steal elections republicans cannot win it started with the impeachment of president clinton when the republicans could not beat him in 1996 it continued in florida where they stopped the vote count depriving thousands of americans of the right to vote this year theyre trying to steal additional congressional seats in colorado and texas overturning legal redistricting plans here in california the republicans lost the governors race last november now theyre trying to use this recall to seize control of california just before the next presidential election end videotape mr russert thats governor davis interpretation of recent history roger simon mr simon its pure gray davis he always runs against the bogeyman on the right in both his gubernatorial elections he ran against the bogeyman on the right its never vote for gray davis because im a great guy its vote for gray davis because if you dont youll get someone far worse youll get a rightwing republican and that theory that call to action has traction in california which is a liberal democratic state mr russert it is ironic that was his theory his hope and then his lieutenant governor cruz bustamante said you know what im going to put my name on the ballot as an alternative mr brownstein right mr russert just in case recall succeeds and now ron the california democratic delegation in the house led by nancy pelosi the house leader said yeah you know thats a good idea mr brownstein yeah mr russert no on recall yes on bustamante mr brownstein yeah they want that fallback position tim the argument that davis raised in that clip gets him within range but i think even his own staffive talked to some of his advisers this weekbelieve it does not get him over the top i mean that is not going to win him a majority which is what he needs independents are still supporting the recall by a substantial margin in our polls so what the democrats are saying is look davis is equivocal at best this is still a democratic leaning state as roger said if we have someone on the ballot we have obviously a better chance of keeping the governorship and in fact in our poll thats out this morning cruz bustamante is leading arnold schwarzenegger in part because the republican vote is dividing and bustamante is now winning 23 of democrats in the state mr russert lets look at those numbers cruz bustamante now up to 35 percent arnold schwarzenegger at 22 tom mcclintock is at 12 percent peter ueberroth at 7 percent bill simon who withdrew yesterday at 6 percent where those votes will go probably to mcclintock but who knows and arianna huffington way down at 3 percent so the strategy perhaps of saying no to recall yes to bustamante may energize the democratic base and ironically may help davis when in fact he was opposing that strategy mr simon well what weve seen isthis is a stunning poll result to begin with and its a little out of variance with some other polls it doesnt mean its wrong but what were seeing is that the greatest threat to gray davis retaining his seat may not be arnold schwarzenegger it may be cruz bustamante we could in the next six weeks get down to an election where the governor of the state is battling the lieutenant governor of the state to hang on to his job mr brownstein a couple of points about the poll and more broadly whats interesting to me about this poll first of all is as i said the disparity between the the unifying democrats where bustamante is ahead now in large part because hes winning 23 of democrats schwarzenegger in the survey is only winning about 40 percent of republicans mcclintock in particular is a significant competitor for conservative republican votes as you say many of the simon votes may go in that direction the other thing that people in the national press havent focused on enough is that in our poll and in earlier california polls schwarzenegger is not the overwhelmingly popular figure hes being portrayed as the percentage of californians with a negative view of him in our poll is roughly equal to those with a positive view and thats been echoed by earlier survey results he still has a good deal of work to do to convince beyond the republican base voters that this is something that makes sense to take a movie actor and put him in as governor at a time when the state is facing such difficulties mr russert he tried to deal with that on wednesday when he met with former secretary of state and treasury george shultz and investor warren buffett had a news conference lets analyze some of the things he said here is arnold schwarzenegger from wednesday videotape wednesday mr arnold schwarzenegger now does this mean that were going to make cuts yes does this mean education is on the table no does this mean im willing to raise taxes no additional taxes are the last burden that we need to put on the backs of the citizens and businesses of california end videotape mr russert then he was asked however would he absolutely rule out any tax increase and this is what he said videotape wednesday mr schwarzenegger having said that it is clear that we cant ever say never because we can have you know next year an earthquake we can have a natural disaster we could have a terrorist attack or something like that so we can never say never no end videotape mr russert roger simon is that enough to satisfy conservatives who want a clear no tax cut pledge mr simon no and in fact there actually mr russert no tax increase pledge mr simon right theyre asking schwarzenegger to sign a decree to that effect i doubt it will satisfy them look in two weeks schwarzenegger has moved from platitudes to generalities which maybe a sign of progress hes following a lincolnesque campaign it was abraham lincoln who said it is better to keep silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt now this doesnt mean that arnold schwarzenegger is stupid but he has been saying to voters tacitly in another clip in that speech he says you know people dont care about the figures what hes really saying is you elected a guy who knew all about the figures you elected a guy who was an expert on state government had been there for three decades was a staff person lieutenant governor then a governor thats gray davis he knew everything and what you got was deficits higher taxes and chaos arnold is saying youve tried smart now try arnold mr russert and isnt he saying ron why get bogged down in all the weeds and all those numbers im going to bring leadership im going to go to sacramento bring the parties together no one owns me and give me a chance to do it does that message sell mr brownstein well i think it does sell to some independent voters but i basically agree with roger look they say you know to govern is to choose but to choose is to define and i think schwarzeneggers strategy has been that in a field this crowded that he might be able to win with a broad appeal across the electorate with a very low number needed to win a very low percentage and not to try to get too clearly defined on one side of the spectrum or the other and that was part of the reason why i think hes been trying to avoid giving too many specifics that would alienate any bloc of the electorate i think that press conference was pretty effective at bringing back conservatives it didnt go quite as far perhaps as some would hope but he really muted a lot of the criticism people like rush limbaugh who had earlier been critical described it as a home run the problem though is as he becomes more acceptable to republicans inevitably he becomes less acceptable to democrats his numbers among democrats in our poll are very poor both favorable and on the actual ballot and he is becoming more of a conventional republican candidate which is tough in a state that leans democratic like california especially if those other two prominent republicans ueberroth and mcclintock stay on the ballot mr russert yeah but if they drop out and endorse arnold schwarzenegger doesnt he become the face of the republican party in a democratic state mr brownstein he does but at least then i think he would have a clearer shot you can imagine tim if these poll numbers like this persist the pressure on those other republicans is going to grow enormous to get out of the race and give schwarzenegger a clear shot at the second part of the ballot mr russert roger you mentioned arnold schwarzenegger saying the public doesnt care about figures this morning in the washington post the president of the united states was talking about the deficit he said im much more concerned about creating jobs than numbers on paper mr simon well the two campaigns have some similarities to bushs first gubernatorial campaign run by karl rove who also we believe has been giving some advice to arnold schwarzenegger which is basically that if youre up against a candidate who has a lot of expertise dont get into a battle over facts and figures dont get into a battle over the details when you see arnold schwarzenegger on tv you always see him doing one of two things laughing or smiling and in his press conference he talked about optimism repeatedly he is the candidate whos optimistic about californias future and when you see gray davis arnold hopes you see the sort of crouched figure always talking about doom and gloom and how you need him to get you through these tough times mr russert was there another actor from california who was known mr simon yeah yeah yes mr russert for his optimism mr simon it was ronald reagan mr russert by the name of ronald reagan let me turn to presidential politics mr simon yeah mr russert john zogbys been polling about george w bush on job approval positivenegative here it is 52 percent positive negative 48 percent and on the question should president bush be reelected yes 45 percent no 48 percent newsweek shows a very similar result today now thats a generic however mr brownstein yeah mr russert its not bush vs candidate kerry or gephardt or dean its anyone else but what does that number tell you ron mr brownstein well look the real thing you have to watch when you have an incumbent president is his approval rating the overwhelming majority of people who give the president a positive approval rating vote for him for reelection and the fact is that bush is being dragged down right now by news at home and abroad at home he is at risk of being the first president since herbert hoover to suffer a net loss of jobs over his full presidential term and of course in iraq the news has been sort of unrelentingly bad one day after another of sort of steady literal bleeding of american troops over there the upsurge of terrorism as well if both of those circumstances continue and president bush has a low 50just over 50 approval rating we go back to the 5050 nation and that is the underlying reality that were facing the country is divided in a partisan sense he has soared above that based on his approval post911 and iraq if that begins to puncture i think we revert back to this very even partisan divide mr russert howard dean former governor of vermont has been telling people roger simon that you know the conventional wisdom said that the democratic candidate had to support the president on the war in order to reinforce his national security credentials but ladies and gentlemen come next november i will be the only democrat who will have the rationale to oppose the president because by opposing the war in iraq i was right and all the other democrats were wrong mr simon well howard dean has clearly shown himself not only to be far more in tune with his party than some of the other democrats but perhaps if these poll results are correct the nation as a whole dean said the strategy of supporting bush on iraq getting national security off the table and fighting george bush on domestic issues was a losing idea it lost in 2002 he said lets energize the base of the party instead of going for the vast american middle which well not win anyway lets go for our democratic base and this whole campaign in a few short months really has evolved into a stop howard dean movement on the part of the other democrats this guy is just tearing up the field mr brownstein i agree largely but i disagree with one point first of all i agree that dean has become the driving force in the democratic race i mean his ability to raise money off the internetthe crowds that he is drawing this weekendhes on a sort of sleepless across america tour that hes doing it began last night in virginia with about several thousand 4000 people by some estimates hes going to be going across the country theyre expecting to raise at least as much money in the third quarter as they did in the second when they raised more money than any other democrat extraordinary situation tim where the outsider candidate has become identified before the insider establishment favorite the only thing i differ with roger on is look it is still going to be a challenge for dean if he is the nominee to explain to the american people why he did not think it was in our national security interest to remove saddam hussein the threshold of being an effective and credible commander in chief is larger and more important after september 11 than it was before and i still believe that it will be a challenge for dean to cross that threshold having opposed the war not impossible but certainly more of a challenge than its been so far with bush pushing back at him not just dick gephardt and john edwards mr russert you may have a perfect storm gathering right now that is not good news for president bush the unemployment numbers the difficulties in iraq no weapons of mass destruction no saddam hussein on the other hand if you find saddam hussein find weapons of mass destruction and the economy starts ticking up then what does howard dean base his campaign on mr simon well howard dean and everyone else is in big trouble based on that scenario and as you pointed out tim the presidents relatively bad poll numbers are the president vs a generic democrat the president isnt going to run against a generic democrat hes going to run against a real democrat if its howard dean and theres no reason to believe this early that it will be the president might feel that hes going to match up very well mr russert the draftwesleyclarkcom group has a new poll out tomorrow in which they show the president matched up against the various democrats the president beats the democrats but hes below 50 percent against most of them they also show that their man clarkin generic form when you describe his biography against george bush they like wesley clark do you think clark gets in mr simon i think clark gets in and i think he hurts a lot of people in the democratic race including howard dean hes antiwar but he has a generals credentials also he hurts those candidates running from the south john edwards and bob graham because wesley clark is from arkansas also he hurts john kerry because he will become the second veteran combatdecorated vietnam veteran in the race and john kerry loses his main talking point which is thats what john kerry is mr russert those mccain independent voters in new hampshire some going to dean some going to kerry now would have a choice in wesley clark mr brownstein yeah well look i mean if he does get inand i think most people are feeling that he is going toit would be a good time for him because there is a sense in the democratic party that apart from dean none of these candidates have really taken off this year theyre all either flat lining or somewhat losing ground over the course of 2003 on the other hand having seen him speak i think he is still much more confident and assured talking about foreign than domestic policy and obviously for a democratic primary electorate iraq is only part of the mix theres a lot of people who want to talk about health care the economy the budget deficit and he has some work i think to do on those fronts mr russert no one else getting in no hillary mr brownstein no no mr simon no no this is mr brownstein no no no mr russert no al gore no al gore mr simon nine may grow to 10 i dont think its going to go past that no al gore mr brownstein yeah no i thinkno al gore i think you got mr russert what you see is what we get mr brownstein what you see is what we get mr simon thats good thats good mr brownstein were going to see some more announcements were goingthe debates are starting soon i mean mr simon right mr brownstein therethis has moved down the road and you know dean in particular has established a following that really isnt going away i mean he has got some ability to stay in this for a while past iowa and new hampshire mr russert message money and momentum mr simon right hes all got all that mr russert but is the democratic nomination worth winning mr simon oh its very much worth winning mr brownstein yes mr russert this is mr simon this election is not a lock for the president mr russert its going to be wild mr brownstein yeah absolutely look if youunless conditions are offthecharts good for bush its a 5050 country and well have a close race mr russert ron

politifact8537,1,the committee on energy and commerce barton medicare drug program drawing participants by the thousands washington us rep joe barton rtexas chairman of the house energy and commerce committee made the following statement today during the full committee hearing on the administrations fy 07 health care priorities good afternoon let me begin by welcoming secretary michael leavitt today to the energy and commerce committee we look forward to hearing him testify about the administrations fiscal year 2007 health care priorities first mr secretary i want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the medicaid program starting this year as a former governor yourself you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program through passage of the deficit reduction act we will sustain medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program the reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse i look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states i want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law that have not recently received the public attention that they deserve according to the congressional budget office 115000 disabled children covered by the family opportunity act will receive improved health care services as a result of the recently passed deficit reduction act the new law will provide access to new home and community based care to 120000 individuals and it will facilitate 100000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through the administrations money follows the person demonstration these are the true results of medicaid reform better access to better care for those who most need our assistance there is still much to be done to improve longterm care service delivery and financing as well as to promote medicaid managed care i have received the administrations proposals regarding additional improvement to the medicaid program and i look forward to working with you this year on them this year the secretary and the administration also are required to administer the new medicare prescription drug benefit making this program succeed is a high priority of yours and it is a high priority of this committee that i chair since it began critics have tried to make patients believe that they are not smart enough to understand the new medicare drug benefit that it provides inadequate coverage and that signing up isnt worth their time because it cannot save them any money the critics are simply wrong they were wrong when they complained about the medicare prescription drug card they were wrong when they said nobody would offer any insurance plans and they are wrong now some sense political advantage in condemning the program and others cant bring themselves to admit that free markets actually work transparency and competition will drive down prices and provide lower costs to consumers even if the critics dont get it medicare beneficiaries certainly do that is why over 36 million medicare beneficiaries have already signed up for the new benefit you told me earlier today that there are close to 24 million americans that have been enrolled in the program through one means or another and enrollment is increasing at approximately 250000 people per week that sounds like a success story to me if you add that to the fact that the premiums which we estimated at 37 a month is now down to an average 27 per month that appears to me to be a successful program this is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches my goal is the same as yours get rid of the glitches the committee will work closely with yourself and dr mark mcclellan at cms to get problems noticed and solved we will have the first of what will likely be several hearings on this topic on march 1 when dr mcclellan will testify before the health subcommittee i expect that we ask him very direct questions about where the problems are and what cms is doing to fix them another high priority for the committee will be the reauthorization of the national institutes of health nih and related programs i want to restate my deep commitment to reauthorizing the nih and would ask for the secretarys assistance in working out the technical details so that we can enact this long overdue legislation in addition the authorization for the ryan white care act has now lapsed i believe that funding unauthorized programs is not a responsible practice and i anticipate that the committee will work to reauthorize these programs this year i also intend to work with you this year on ways to reform medicare reimbursement and particularly focus on physician payment reform in order to preserve access to medicare services for future generations we must look at how we are spending our medicare dollars today and what are the incentives are for our physician community to continue providing quality health care another top priority of the committee will be to work with you on the proposals outlined in the administrations budget to provide consumers with greater access to comparative price and quality data about their health care providers i could go on but my time has expired

gossipcop-858434,1,the hills producers finally tell us what was real what was fake there are things the cast does not want to talk about like lauren and the sex tape as producers for us the challenge is getting access to what we know is the real story lauren would forever say im not mentioning heidis name or im not doing the show if shes on the show we were so sympathetic to that but at the same time you had heidi wanting to make up with lauren still wanting to be a part of the show and you had the sex tape rumors that lauren didnt want to talk about yet that was a betrayal that was so important and such a big elephant in the room that we just had to work with lauren and say alright so what are we going to do we are going to have to access this somehow its always a discussion lauren didnt want to confront heidi that was a catchthedrama moment as reality tv producers we are hoping these two will meet up you know we were lucky enough to be there at the nightclub where we thought heidi and spencer might show up we knew lauren was there and i think we knew they might show upi dont want to get into the specifics of the sex tape rumors just because thats their story but from what we got on tape it all just kind of came to a head at that nightclub we were at les deux and heidi ended up showing up with spencer and lauren and heidi got into it outside we werent even aware that they were fighting i mean you can see at the beginning of that scene that were scrambling to get our cameras there theres even a shot of cameras which we go to great lengths to avoid but because it was happening in real time and it really went down it erupted and happened so quickly that we just hustled to get it justin bobby brescia is the anti spencer pratt on the hills hes still a shitty reality tv boyfriend please refer to the times audrina caught him making out with other women while she was at the same club but he has this seductive power that makes it easy to see why audrina returns to him time after time justin bobby speaks in ridiculous platitudes like truth and time tells all which now sound like everything spewed on the bachelor but back then were unique in their somehow grounded inanity its hard to believe that he isnt putting on an act for cameras or behaving a certain way due to producer intervention both divello and travis insist that it didnt take any special editing to depict justin bobbys essence to audiences nor did much of his footage wind up on the cutting room floorwe knew audrina was dating justin bobby all of season 2 we were thinking oh my gosh audrina has no story all she does is go on dates with these guys these funny characters but then we knew she had this boyfriend and we werent getting access to this story line we said to her we know this is happening we know youre dating this guy it took a lot of work and i think it was producer sara mast who came on in season 3 she was able to get justin to trust usjustins such a genuinely nice person off camera to our crew and to all of us he never gave us a problem he was always very polite and thankful i think justin was a surprise each week because he was like im starting to look like such an ass on the show can you not make me look so bad we werent doing any of it we kept explaining to him youre doing this all to yourself youre just seeing this on camera but this is how you are i think he was such a great character and he was such a natural on camerain audrina and justins case that was the relationship in which he was the bad guy who was really charming she was always trying to break up with him or get away from him and his seductive power every time she would want to do it if she broke up with him off camera we would want her to at least have a conversation with him on camera so we could see that process and inevitably they would get back together so that turned out to be a long drawnout story line whats interesting too is that you do a lot of shooting with cast members and then some of the best stuff makes the cut but with justin he was so unwilling to shoot it was very hard he would give us so little of his time and i think that there arent any shoots we did with justin bobby that didnt make it to air i think every single scene we shot with him is on television lauren conrads mascara tears during her fight with audrina in season 4 have become the gif that keeps on giffing from the hills in 2013 conrad told cosmopolitan that producers had slowed down her single tear to make it even more dramatic and that whoops she wasnt wearing waterproof mascara the producers actually received letters asking why she didnt think to apply makeup that would withstand her tearsthe mascara thing just happened and it became a thing most of the time when we were shooting we would be sitting on their balcony like six or seven of us crammed on this tiny little balcony youre watching little monitors and when you get that like black eyeliner roll youre just like damn this is so great because again we dont have those tocamera confessionals those otfs we call them in the business so we have no other device to tell stories other than something like a black mascara line running down her face you clearly notice shes upset and thats so far and few between other than the help of music thats really all we have so those were extremely helpful to us and they kind of became laurens hallmark we got so many letters that were like why didnt she wear waterproof mascara and i never could answer that i didnt knowi think it might have been slowed down in the trailer but not in the show it would be a little strange in the episode when were supposed to be in a kind of realtime scene for the tear to slow down we would joke that wed have these scenes where lauren is finally going to talk to audrina and we would swear that lauren would wear the runny mascara where because of that she would literally win the scene theyre both crying and audrinas mascara wouldnt run and laurens would therefore our hearts would go out to lauren we thought does she do it on purpose does she wear the runny mascara because she wants to win i mean i dont think so she tries so hard not to cry she used to say guys im so tired of crying on the show

proper and sinewy so i really watched what i ate just the usual stuff whatever the character needed thats what we did q the guys you have in the movie were gungho to just have a double wedding but you wouldnt have had a movie if that happened in your real lives if the situation were similar would you have just had a double wedding kate yeah i would have thought it would be more fun it would be a bigger party and there would be a bigger ballroom in real life i probably would have been like i dont even know if i want to get married go ahead but then again theres that little part of you thats like no its my one day anne and i think you would also want your friend to have that day as well you want it for yourself but youre also like i dont want to be diluted in my joy for you i wouldnt have a double wedding economically absolutely its fantastic but psychologically i think youd always be kinda pissed kate it would be kinda weird if one of the grooms vows were better anne the competition would be horrible kate if fletchers vows were better than daniels vows that would feel weird anne fletchers vows would never be better than daniels vows laughs kate youd be like oh that kinda sucked anne maybe you would read too much into it i think a double wedding would cause you to analyze it too closely and read too much into it youd have an immediate comparison that being said if anybody here has had a double wedding im sure it was lovely q what are your plans for this holiday season particularly given the economic state were in what sort of gifts will you be giving anne im doing a lot of research right now on cool gifts for under 50 the real simple magazine has an amazing gift guide right now you have to see it its so good it makes me feel like a successful human being when i

i was just like yeah i really do like clothes so it was great to realize that im still myself but i can be girly as well its been a nice little stay kate you didnt learn that in the princess diaries anne no i fought it all the way kate thats the girliest movie of all time every little girl wants to be a girl because of that movie anne i never wanted to be a princess so i was focused on my characters psychological torture at that time she had to accept an identity that she wasnt ready for i missed the point laughs its actually been really nice to be in this movie and be around such strong female energy and to find that so liberating when i grew up i had this idea that i would be defined by a way that id be uncomfortable with and ive actually been made much better because of it im much stronger and more open and more loving and more compassionate this movie was really good for me in that way kate it was an interesting time for all of us especially in the age were both in youre going through so many transitions and for some reason being around women you become empowered by your girlfriends and by other women that you learn from which is what the movie is about having those friendships poor gary winick he was the one man it was all girls the producers and executives were all females and the stars of the movie he was just surrounded by the ladies and when you get a lot of girls in a room watch out its a powerful energy and this movie felt really good for that we were all going through these amazing coming out parties it was really interesting it was fun q can you talk about the bachelorette party scene and the danceoff anne all good comedy is painful and horrifying to actually do but i felt very protected by my characters drunkenness so i knew that if it didnt quite turn out the way that id hoped that it would be okay because i did project onto it i really wanted to be a good dancer but i am not a good dancer watching the movie is hard for me because im just like im trying really hard and i just look silly and drunk laughs but on the day it was just hysterical it was fun the fact of the matter is that we had a great cast to work with and that day we had a lot of background artists in that scene and everybody was really into it and was giving so much it just felt fun my favorite part of the scene got cut out of the movie at the end of it i run up to officer notyourhusband and i did a handstand at his feet and wrapped my legs around his head and then pulled myself up and then he grabbed my butt and i opened my legs wide into a v and i say book me doing that take after take after take felt so good this movie did stretch some of my boundaries kate i was so scared when you were doing that i was so terrified that you were going to go right over his head anne and i nailed it every time kate i was sitting there going shes going to wipe out i cant watch this laughs but she did it and she never did anne kate has great faith in my physical abilities q will they put that on the dvd kate theres a lot that should be on this dvd we had a lot of good outtakes on this movie we also have some behindthescenes footage that we did thats kind of funny the dvd extras should be rated r laughs anne when we made the movie we never knew where we wanted the humor to be so we did raunchy versions of jokes i think very few of the raunchy ones wound up in the movie and probably for the best kate the dvd will be really funny q a lot of people will enjoy this movie but some people may feel that it perpetuates the negative bridezilla stereotype what would you say to those people anne when i got the script that was what i anticipated and i was really sensitive to that i just thought theres no point in making a movie that is reductive to women in the whole process so i was so happy when i read the script that the movie takes the tact that the bridezilla thing doesnt have a lot to do in our movie with actually getting what you want and being the center of attention thats the myth that plays into at least my characters consciousness but what it actually does is bring her to a new place of freedom where shes admitting to herself that she wants more for herself and she wants better for herself and that leads her to make an incredibly difficult but ultimately wonderful decision to take control of her life and be more present and be more demanding and to set boundaries with people and to be stronger and more confident so to those people that believe we perpetuate a stereotype i say come to see the film if you disagree with us i will answer the strongly worded letter that im sure you will write but we were supersensitive to that in the beginning kate and i are both strong women that want to do everything we can to make sure that every woman feels strong so we would never do anything that would set women back kate as producer of the film in developing this when it came as a pitch it was like wow i cant believe this movie hasnt really been made the more i thought about it i realized its because its so easy to pit women against each other and get carried away with the cattiness and the pettiness of the stereotypes of how women handle lots of situations for me i looked at it as a challenge i thought wait a minute this is such a great thing for women to be able to make fun of themselves we are a little guilty of going a little crazy sometimes and getting stressed out and i think women are great at being selfdeprecating and making fun of themselves but we dont get the opportunities as a female comedian to do that that often there arent really that many femaledriven comedies so in developing it i felt that there was a way to try to make a movie that is appealing to all ages of women that doesnt leave anybody out and at the end of this wild funny thing that we can all relate to a little bit or feel is a little bit accessible is about friendship and honoring your friends and the importance of having those people in your life none of these things matter if you dont have your girls that was the trick that was really hard and we really worked hard on that especially gary who i have to say did such a great job of making this movie have that real emotional undertone that took me by surprise the first time i saw the first cut that was the one thing i was most concerned with and it really did make me go okay i want to go call my girlfriends thats why we made the movie i hope women will appreciate that q kate what makes daniel a keeper for liv and whats the perfect guy for you kate i dont know yet i dont know what the perfect guy is yet i do know that i like honest guys that always gets me going i like guys who are really upfront and just are who they are theyre hard to find anne yes they are laughs kate what i liked about the guys in this movie and what i liked about the relationships that we both have which are so different is that it was unexpected liv would be the expected one to be divorced in two years whereas emma would probably be the one who people would think would have this long lasting relationship and go through the worst possible times and just still be married so we liked playing that liv actually found somebody who could deal with her and knew how to handle her and emma needed the person in her life who allowed her to look at herself and go you know what i need something else and something different anne because liv knows exactly what she wants and who she is she needed to find someone who found her adorable he probably prefers her when shes being herself and happy but also finds her messiness when shes stressed out great and he gets it and accepts it because emma is in some ways having a latent rebellion she needs someone who is going to want her to be happy above all and wants her to explore every part of herself and is willing to accept whatever she finds and they each do find that in their own way the sad thing about emma is that emma is that person that marries for keeps once she got married she would have stayed married through anything thats kind of sad because she really would have been unhappy with fletcher kate if this movie is successful and we thought about doing another one we talked about how much fun we would have thinking about where our characters go laughs continued on page 2 split q would it be child wars kate totally it would be baby wars it would be great we could go so many different ways with emma anne we really could laughs kate that would be so fun q why is there so much emphasis placed on a woman getting married do you think theres too much emphasis kate we love love we love relationships i would never be cynical about people wanting that day and being excited about that day i think theres a reason for it its your day to present yourself to your man to throw this party thats about wanting to spend the rest of your life with somebody and bringing everybody together the idea of the ceremony is great the reality of the ceremony becomes stressful i think the emphasis on marriage will always be important for people no matter what kind of marriage they choose whether its getting hitched on the top of the himalayas with just the two of them or having a 300person wedding i feel like people always want that ceremony when we all sit around and have coffee or drinks the first thing we talk about is kids and then we talk about our relationships and love and loss and drama in love its such a big topic for us so i think celebrating it will always be something that people will emphasize anne to be perfectly honest i dont know laughs i dont know because i dont personally feel any pressure to get married i dont feel it from my family i dont feel it from my friends and i dont feel it from within so i dont really know how to answer that question but im not everyone i dont know if there is a pressure on women to get married or if its something that women put on themselves or if its the way things have been done and were not yet in a new moment where things have transitioned into people accepting that anything goes and you can do whatever you want i think there is something to be said about living the happiest life possible but the only way that you can live a happy life specific to yourself is if you are yourself and if youre the sort of person that never wants to get married never get married who cares and if youre the sort of person that really loves the idea of being committed to someone and having that piece of paper that says that you are committed to someone and celebrating with either a huge party or a quiet party go for it just be yourself the important thing to note though is moreso than whether or not women feel pressure to get married i think we need to work on making it possible for everyone in america to get married q when crossed are women meaner to each other than men anne i love that everybody thinks we have all these answers laughs kate i dont know because i grew up with all boys and so did anne anne its hard to say kate you know what yeah i think so because women are a little bit more complicated i think women can really hit you where it hurts q with a knife or a gun kate no thats men men go right for the shins whereas i think women can be more hurtful because were more emotional but i dont know anne being mean is awful i do believe that female friends can be worse to each other than male friends simply because for whatever reason women have a stronger emotional language were encouraged more to use that kate and i know things about each other that i dont know about my male costars and if kate and i were to turn on each other because i know how to celebrate her i would also know how to bring her down and she would know the same for me when you give that trust to someone that is what youre doing kate its so true we talk girls talk about everything anne we talk about what were feeling about deep things maybe theyre not even particularly deep in the grand scheme of things but theyre things that matter to us so when you give someone that power youre showing them where your buttons are if you pick wrong and someone turns around and shortcircuits those buttons i think it hurts more kate when you go through relationships all of a sudden you realize god boys dont have anybody to talk to that must really be horrible they just dont talk about their feelings with each other they talk to their girlfriends my guy friends call me and theyre like girls theyre like hey can you talk and im like yeah sure and theyre like im having problems with my girlfriend they talk to their girls but they dont talk to boys about it they really dont my brothers talk to me but they dont talk to their friends q can you talk about working with candice bergen who has played some pretty strong female characters in her career anne we were just totally in awe of her i would look at her and get emotional i kept just wanting to thank her for so much and shes still so fabulous shes so quick when i get shy around people especially around people that i deeply respect like candice and some of the other actresses that im privileged enough to work with my instinct is to hang back and just observe them just watching her and the way she takes in the environment and the way she plays with a line she could clearly just relax and enjoy the ride and be herself and that would be enough but she really cares she would show up every day and explore to see that kind of passion in someone of any age was inspiring but particularly to see someone like candice bergen who is such a powerful woman and means so much to so many women like us was really cool q is there a particular moment on this that stands out for you kate probably when we were so tired and we were on the floor with our torn up wedding dresses thats my favorite shot in the movie we were lying there looking at each other and we were there for hours at one point we were on our sides and we were just talking lying on the floor that was probably my most memorable moment because you dont get to work with girls this closely very often its always with a guy anne one of the things that im just so excited about with this film is that so often in films that weve been in theres the main character and then theres the quirky best friend that you never really get to know who comes in with the great oneliner to have two complex female characters who are best friends at the center of a movie i havent really seen that before so anytime we were in those scenes where we got to go deeper and there wasnt that formula in place in the script i was feeling something new as an actress for the first time because i have never been in a situation like that and kate was just there every time listening and going deeper with me there wasnt one specific moment there were so many just to get to return to those scenes again and again and again it shouldnt be rare but it really is i remember that and im really appreciative of it kate we did the end at like four in the morning for the wedding scene where were both crying it was so late and i remember as a producer theyre like can we get to you last and youre like sure we can do that scene last i did that whole scene at 430 or five in the morning after being up all day we were doing it and i was at that place where i was like okay i could go right to sleep right now i could just curl up and go to bed our characters had been fighting that day and doing so much stuff and we did the scene i was in it and i was getting a little tearyeyed and i looked at annie and she was getting tearyeyed and i was like i love being girls laughs we were right there for each other and thats what the movie is about there were a lot of good moments annie is the best because shell be like i have this idea and id be like okay what and shed say this idea and then be like okay it was a really bad idea anne id be like there is something good in there lets pick it apart kate annie is the first one to do that it was so great it was so funny q what did you relate to and what didnt you relate to in the script anne ive never really thought about my wedding so i think part of the reason why i was drawn to the script was because here was a girl that i had no relationship to i didnt understand that concept of identifying with yourself as a bride before it had occurred to you to identify with yourself as a woman as far as the bride specific thing but i did know what it was like because i thought of myself i guess as an actress i really wanted that when i was a kid and so i developed that and assumed that i would develop as a person aside from that and that didnt happen its taken a lot of work to figure out who i am and what i want aside from what it is that ive put in my head and to be here in reality and not just living the dream that i wanted and accepting that things are different and far more interesting than they were when i thought of them when i was 8 and just accept that that was wonderful i identified with that kind of desire in my character that process and the hunger for that process and then i understood the female friendship its beautiful powerful and scary to mean so much to someone its so fun but also so much responsibility in the best possible way i was so happy because in the script and i hope im not speaking out of turn by revealing this but we didnt figure out that ending until just before we always knew that there was a piece missing and we couldnt quite figure it out we were just talking and kate told a story and we all burst into tears because the point of the story was that as much fun as marriage hopefully is and as much as we all want to find that one person that fulfills us and not exactly have the fairy tale but be able to rely on that person you cant its a sad sad sad fact but whatever happens in your life in the great moments the bad moments and the unexpected moments theres always going to be someone there refilling your wine glass giving you a shoulder to cry on picking you up and celebrating with you and thats your girlfriend we didnt find that message in the movie until much much much later and then as soon as we did it all made sense thats what i related to fully and thats when i fully fully fully gave in to it q do you mean that scene where you come back from hawaii anne no the final monologue about how weddings are great and the dream is great and its so much fun but dont kate conceptually thats what it was but when we sat down we were talking about trying to fix the end of the movie we all sat around and i told this story about my mother basically my brother was getting married and we had this bridal shower for my sisterinlaw and my mom made this speech and she said i want all the girls to look around the room and even if you dont know each other even if youre just getting to know each other or even if its your sister i want you to remember one thing trust me men they come and go they always will hopefully they stay but its the girl thats sitting next to you or the girl thats sitting across from you thats going to get you through everything my mom is filled with all these little wisdoms like that thats really important that idea of not losing sight no matter where you go in your life with men because women give a lot to men we love relationships we thrive in them as we should but sometimes you lose sight of the girls that are there for you all the time which we shouldnt hold against any of our friends i have a girlfriend right now whos off and running with somebody but were always there for each other when shes ready to pick up the phone and go i dont know what to do were all there and thats what the movies about and so when we sat around and talked about that thats where we came up with that end because its hard to tie these types of movies together and have something that makes you feel something emotional and that makes all the other crazy stuff worth it q kate what did you or didnt you relate to with your character kate i feel like just creatively im constantly watching other people i have so many friends that are all so different and all things are different to other people so i could relate to a lot whether its me thats like that or my best girlfriend im so not like liv so i based the whole hair thing after my one girlfriend who is in the hair salon like two times a week she wont dip her foot in water because her hair might get frizzy that to me is liv i cant relate to that but i can because i know somebody whos like that and it cracks me up but in terms of weddings and stuff i can relate to it because i like to dress up i like to have a party i like to throw parties i like to bring people together look everybody has their own opinion as to the sanctity of marriage or what it is they believe i come from two parents who arent married well i come from one parent who ended up not marrying my other parent i come from a complicated household so its a little unconventional how i see marriage but i can relate to it i got married and it was great it was a blast everybody should do it laughs q would you get married again kate you know possibly i dont know if its right if its important to everybody but i dont know i dont know who the guy would be yet it would all depend on what kind of relationship that is you know q congratulations to anne hathaway on getting named best actress by the national board of review for rachel getting married how do you feel about all that anne as im sure you can imagine its hugely overwhelming im delighted but it doesnt seem real it seems to be an embarrassment of riches that i supposed i have to learn to get comfortable with q anne can you talk about your role in alice in wonderland anne i play the white queen in it and i think thats all that i need to say

that sucks because its such a nice noun since we know youre secretly dying to know which paradise couples are still smooching in sunkissed harmony heres the lowdown on all of the duos who decided to show up to the aftershow finale if only they were all success stories but where would be the drama in that john and olivia status parted ways not too amicably despite frequent calls video chats and a trip together the couple broke up a few weeks after paradise ended citing distance as the main factor well john did anyway because as olivia says john chose to publicize a relationship with fellow paradiseer chelsea on social media over her twist for me i felt like our different lifestyles couldnt make that work right now john explained but then when i saw you were publicizing other relationships you were facetiming her when you couldve been facetiming me olivia responded and that was a slap in my face colton and tia status theyre friends and they really want us to know it our long national nightmare is over or rather just beginning with colton being anointed as the next bachelor we personally love our proud messy virgin it should come as no surprise that colton and his

become clear to me until i went home i spoke to my family i went back to therapy and i realized it was my own fault and it was my own baggage kevin explained noting that the pressure to go to the fantasy suite triggered him from his previous experience with ashley i i brought baggage to paradise and she got blamed for it i feel terrible about it and it was definitely hard to watch as for astrid she forgave kevins apology they exchanged i love yous in front of everyone and the future is looking bright for these two kendall and joe status also back together thank god kendall just a few days after breaking up with joe and leaving paradise decided to hightail it to chicago in the hopes of winning back her man and expressing how much she regretted her decision despite some initial pushback from joe about if his feelings were still there i felt in my heart that she felt she made a mistake he put it kendalls emotional breakthrough helped ease his pain and encourage him to give her another chance i couldnt help but feel a bunch of regret i was projecting how i actually was she said during their chicago meetup i was the one actually holding back i know it doesnt justify it but the reason why i had fear and the reason why i was pulling my back so much was that i am in love with you the duo have since visited each other multiple times and are in a stable relationship kamil and anneliese status oh honey we all knew this wasnt going to last kamil decided to breakup with anneliese during the aftershow hasnt he learned anything from arie setting her off into a spiral

really tried kamil just said the postparadise bubble made him realize they werent meant to be together i dont want to string you along i think it would be best for us to slowly part ways chris and

gossipcop-1416257068,0,sure kate middleton looks great but lets talk about what giving birth really does to womens bodies sure kate middleton looks great but lets talk about what giving birth really does to womens bodies play seven hours after giving birth to her third child in less than five years kate middleton the duchess of cambridge stood before the media in heels and a cherry red jenny packham dress cradling her darling new prince the internet exploded some women pronounced the duchess superhuman others offered blunt comparisons to their own postpartum conditions mercifully most seemed to realize kates seemingly supernatural ability to bounce back is not normal but by focusing so much on her flawless appearance we are distracted from the real trauma physical and emotional that is the childbirth experience i have three kids twins the first time one born vaginally the second four hours later by cesarean section and a singleton also by cesarean section after 16 hours of labor and two hours of unsuccessful pushing my pregnancies apart from the unplanned csections were normal and uneventful and i went through all the things the vast majority of postpartum women experience kate too probably vaginal bleeding uterine cramps engorged breasts raging hormones soreness exhaustion constipation and the general condition of feeling as if youve been run over by a truck a significant number of women more than half by some counts experience pelvic injury or dysfunction as a result of childbirth but we dont like to talk about these things and we definitely dont like to talk about the longer term physical struggles many postpartum women endure urinary and fecal incontinence acute pelvic pain back pain muscle tears hairline fractures prolapsed bladder pain during sex if one can even summon the desire low sex drive is another unpleasant side effect and the mummy tummy medically known as diastasis recti what happens when a womans abdomen stretches and separates to accommodate a growing fetus but fails to knit itself back together many of these symptoms dont appear immediately and because these topics are not often talked about women often assume symptoms are just the new normal womens health is the most popular of political footballs to some people its still a preexisting condition to be a woman and its also the most stigmatized the female genitalia in particular is a gray area a taboo even something referred to as down there or private parts or if youre oprah vajayjay the pelvic floor the hammock of muscles that hold a womans bladder bowel and uterus where they belong isnt visible like a quad muscle and it can be hard for women to pinpoint areas of discomfort most people dont even know what a pelvis looks like apart from a skeleton theyve seen during halloween advertisement donna chiao dpt an orthopedic and pelvic health physical therapist holds a model pelvis courtesy of the author but a significant number of women more than half by some counts experience pelvic injury or dysfunction as a result of childbirth think about the women you know who joke about wetting their pants just a little bit when they laugh one in three report urinary incontinence after childbirth or resign themselves to pain during sex thats about onethird of all women too or just assume a lumpy tummy as my kids so lovingly called mine is part of motherhood not enough women know they can resolve some if not all of these issues with physical therapy after the birth of my third child i was eager to get back to my regular running routine when my obgyn gave me the all clear at my postpartum appointment i vowed to start back slowly running for a minute then walking for a minute to regain my strength and stamina after a few jogs i was hobbling around worried that my insides might fall out and splatter against the pavement i called my doctor the very one who gave me the green light she recommended a couple of places for womens specific physical therapy but the waitlist at mt auburn hospital where i delivered was 45 names long so long they werent even willing to add my name to the queue i was eventually able to get an appointment with an outstanding womens health therapist at marathon sports in newton but i had to wait six weeks for my first appointment my experience isnt uncommon there are more women who need help than specialists who can provide care at marathon the average wait is four to six months part of the scarcity of care has to do with the extensive clinical training pelvic floor specialists need to do internal pelvic exams my pt donna chiao completed seven years of education beyond high school not including all the continuing education courses she had to take after receiving her doctorate she told me that anything regarding the pelvic floor is rarely taught as part of the standard physical therapy curriculum even in doctoral degree programs maybe frank conversations in popular culture can help to change the way womens bodies are perceived and treated medically in the end i was lucky my complication pain in the cartilage joint that connects my pubic bones known as pubic symphysis pain was resolved with strength training and lots of foam rolling but i was incensed that my obgyn gave me the goahead to start exercising without a thorough evaluation she saw me through my pregnancy but bore no responsibility to treat me in its aftermath in france all postpartum women are prescribed 10 visits with a pelvic floor physical therapist as a standard of care and have been since 1985 the good news is there are inklings that the way our culture talks about womens health and childbirth may be changing samantha bee did a hilarious bit on the history of womens pain gwen jorgensen the olympic triathlon champion turnedmarathoner talks openly about her postpartum pelvic floor rehabilitation abby norman and lena dunham have written about their harrowing experiences with endometriosis meghan oconnells new book and now we have everything talks about early motherhood with a compelling rawness my entire middle section looked like a balloon that had been deflated but also somehow was full of wet dough load youtube video maybe frank conversations in popular culture can help to change the way womens bodies are perceived and treated medically for now though i hope the duchess of cambridge is home resting in giant mesh underwear and support leggings sipping tea in between appointments with her womens health specialist

politifact8611,1,israel should welcome rouhanis election victory such a reaction would be understandable if saeed jalili the most antiwestern ultraconservative candidate had won but why has the israeli government greeted rouhani with hostility the common refrain in israel is that rouhanis moderate image in contrast to his predecessor mahmoud ahmadinejads will hamper israels efforts to keep iran isolated furthermore rouhanis moderate tone could fool the united states and europe into a false sense of security resulting in the lifting of sanctions against iran and even passivity toward the threat of irans nuclear program such concern likely peaked after rouhanis recent visit to the united nations general assembly which led to a number of milestones in irans troubled relationship with the us the meeting between irans foreign minister mohammad javad zarif and us secretary of state john kerry the first such formal talks between the two countries since the 1978 iranian revolution was followed by another major unprecedented milestone a phone call between rouhani and president barack obama to be sure when it comes to rouhanis ability to usher real change to irans nuclear program a healthy dose of skepticism is called for however his election victory is not the threat that netanyahu and his cabinet have alleged in fact there are good reasons for israelis to welcome rouhanis rise to power rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation among the presidential candidates he was the most critical of irans nuclearnegotiation strategy his criticism focused on irans intransigent posture at the talks which forced it to pay a disproportionate price for its nuclear program as rouhani stated in a campaign video on june 5 10 days before the election if centrifuges are turning but the country is dormant then we dont choose this if the arrangement is for natanz irans nuclear enrichment site to work but 100 other factories close because of sanctions and shortage of primary material or they only work at 20 percent of their capacity then this is unacceptable iranian president hassan rouhani was the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run in the countrys june election yet within one month of rouhanis victory israels prime minister benjamin netanyahu publicly called him a wolf in sheeps clothing in what should be good news for israel rouhani could usher in change to irans nuclear stance he enjoys very good relations with irans supreme leader ali khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him for 25 years rouhani was khameneis representative on the supreme national security council snsc which shapes irans national security and defense policies in fact rouhanis relations with khamenei are far better so far than that of his predecessors akbar hashemi rafsanjani mohammad khatami and ahmadinejad khamenei may not have allowed ahmadinejad to shift irans nuclear strategy despite the latters calls for iran to halt enrichment at 20 percent because of bad relations between the two leaders after a public falling out in april 2011 rouhanis rapprochement with the us could also be good news for israeli worries over irans nuclear ambitions improved relations with iran along with the leverage of sanctions could give the us what it needs to extract concessions from tehran over its nuclear program at the same time rouhanis rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to irans hardliners israels most ardent enemies in fact this is already happening in less than two months since coming to power rouhani is already changing parts of irans stance on the holocaust much to the fury of irans ultraconservatives last but not least rouhanis election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against iran such as the restrictions against irans central bank that israel had demanded for many years a military attack by israel or the us by contrast would most probably have stiffened irans stance against negotiations so now that the goal of softening irans stance has been achieved it is time to reap its benefits netanyahu appears to believe that rouhani cannot be trusted and must be pressured incessantly even if he offers compromises netanyahu insists that irans entire nuclear program must be dismantled and if iran does not comply military action should be taken the irony in netanyahus harsh line is that it helps rouhani politically in iran praise from any israeli leaders could be detrimental for now netanyahu appears to be attacking rouhani because he genuinely doubts his sincerity and views his overtures as a threat to israel let us hope that instead of hurting rouhani netanyahu ends up helping him rouhanis diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to irans nuclear program

gossipcop-967291458,0,the one with the rumor 9th episode of the 8th season of friends the one with the rumor is the ninth episode of the eighth season of the american television situation comedy friends which aired on nbc on november 22 20011 it continues the series annual thanksgivingthemed episode tradition and gueststars cast member jennifer anistons thenhusband brad pitt in the uncredited role of will colbert who reveals that fueled solely by his hatred of rachel green aniston he and ross david schwimmer were part of a club in high school that spread a rumour that rachel was a hermaphrodite the episode was directed by gary halvorson and written by shana goldbergmeehan1 it was nominated for multiple primetime emmy awards but was criticized as insulting by a national intersex education group plot edit monica invites an old school friend of hers and ross for thanksgiving will colbert brad pitt however will reacts very badly when learning that rachel who he hated in high school because of her bullying him will be joining them for dinner rachel is immediately attracted to will unable to recognize him but will is openly hostile and this culminates in his proud announcement that he and ross founded a club in high school that initiated a rumor that she was a hermaphrodite which was spread throughout their entire high school rachel feels betrayed by ross until monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that ross made out with the schools 50yearold librarian though a horrified ross confirms it as true rachel demands that ross recant the rumor by calling everyone from school but monica puts them both in their place by reminding them that rachels rumor put ross on the social radar that ross and wills rumor had no effect whatsoever on rachels queen bee status and that they have too much important history to fixate on the past they agree to be civil and reveal to will that they are now having a baby together will is completely dumbfounded by this revelation but takes pleasure in the fact that ross got rachel pregnant but is not going to marry her he tries to give ross a highfive to celebrate but when ross refuses phoebe who has been crushing on will the entire evening takes the opportunity to hug him because phoebe is a vegetarian chandler hates thanksgiving cuisine rachel has an aversion to poultry and will is on a diet they will not be eating turkey thus monica tells a crestfallen joey that she will not be cooking a turkey because it is not worth it for just 3 people joey admonishes monica and demands the tradition and so monica obliges with a monstrous bird throughout the episode joey battles the enormous turkey eventually changing into phoebes maternity clothing which she was giving to rachel earlier in the episode to ease the strain on his stomach the episode culminates in joey finishing off the turkey and getting the meat sweats despite being extremely full joey still has room for pie production edit it was reported by entertainment weekly that pitt would don a fat suit for flashback scenes to his fat childhood2 though this was unfounded as wills weight was merely referred to on screen3 pitt frequently visited aniston at the studios before and after his appearance though he did not go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience4 when questioned about his appearance in the show pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film spy game though added that he liked the series anyway3 the episode was taped on november 2 following four days of rehearsals5 reception edit as the series

his cred as a film actor pitt knew he was out of his depth on a sitcom stage after five minutes viewing the audience did too6 his work on set is admired by the main stars schwimmer recalls pitt was definitely going against type7 and matt leblanc called him really great on the show4 usa today rates wills line look at her standing there with those yams my two greatest enemies ross rachel green and

thinking about the intersex joke that was written and greenlit by people who held my community up to the light and tormented us for somehow being by their own standards less human than everyone else10

nominated for outstanding cinematography for a multicamera series while stephen prime was nominated for outstanding multicamera picture editing for a series for their work on the episode11 references

the united arab emirates washington cnn former national security adviser susan rice privately told house investigators that she unmasked the identities of senior trump officials to understand why the crown prince of the united arab emirates was in new york late last year multiple sources told cnn the new york meeting preceded a separate effort by the uae to facilitate a backchannel communication between russia and the incoming trump white house the crown prince sheikh mohammed bin zayed alnahyan arrived in new york last december in the transition period before trump was sworn into office for a meeting with several top trump officials including michael flynn the presidents soninlaw jared kushner and his top strategist steve bannon sources said the obama administration felt misled by the united arab emirates which had failed to mention that zayed was coming to the united states even though its customary for foreign dignitaries to notify the us government about their travels according to several sources familiar with the matter rice who served as thenpresident obamas national security adviser in his second term told the house intelligence committee last week that she requested the names of the americans mentioned in the classified report be revealed internally a practice officials in both parties say is common rices previously undisclosed revelation in a classified setting shines new light on a practice that had come under sharp criticism from the committee chairman california rep devin nunes and president donald trump who previously accused rice of committing a crime but her explanation appears to have satisfied some influential republicans on the committee undercutting both nunes and trump and raising new questions about whether any trump associates tried to arrange backchannel discussions with the russians i didnt hear anything to believe that she did anything illegal florida rep tom rooney a republican helping to lead the panels russia invesigation told cnn of rices testimony he declined to discuss any of the contents of her classified remarks through a spokeswoman rice declined to comment about her testimony nunes refused to answer questions when asked about rice tuesday evening its unclear precisely which trump officials rice discussed at the house meeting but multiple sources have confirmed to cnn that zayed met at the time with flynn kushner and bannon the threehour discussion focused on a range of issues including iran yemen and the mideast peace process according to two sources who insisted that opening up a backchannel with russia was not a topic of discussion still the fact that the new york meeting occurred prior to the seychelles session and that the uae did not notify the obama administration about why the crown prince was coming to the united states has raised questions in the eyes of investigators on capitol hill a secret meeting in the seychelles but the trump tower meeting came shortly before the uae brokered a meeting to open lines of communications with the united states and russia with a clandestine january meeting in the seychelles islands in the indian ocean according to reports in cnn and the washington post that meeting is now under investigation on capitol hill though its unclear whether rice mentioned the seychelles meeting in the testimony a senior middle east official told cnn that the uae did not mislead the obama administration about the crown princes visit but acknowledged not telling the us government about it in advance the meeting which took place december 15 2016 the official said was simply an effort to build a relationship with senior members of the trump team who would be working in the administration to share assessments of the region the meeting was about ascertaining the trump teams view of the region and sharing the uaes view of the region and what the us role should be the official said no one was coming in to sell anything or arrange anything a spokesperson for the crown prince declined to comment the seychelles meeting and the circumstances around it has been a subject of interest to hill investigators looking at any potential link between the trump campaign and russia the washington post initially reported in april that the uae brokered a preinauguration meeting between the founder of the security firm blackwater erik prince who is a close trump ally and an associate of vladimir putins in the seychelles islands the purpose of the meeting was part of an effort by the uae to persuade russia to curtail its relationship with iran including in syria according to the post and it occured shortly after bannon flynn and kushner also met in trump tower with zayed whom the post said helped arrange the seychelles meeting with russia government officials to set up the private discussions with the trump team but the senior middle east official told cnn this week that princes name was not discussed at the trump tower meeting and prince himself has said he did nothing wrong telling cnns erin burnett last month i was there for business both the white house and prince have strongly denied that prince was working as a liaison for the trump administration prince said he met with a russian while at the seychelles but i dont remember his name it probably lasted about as long as one beer he said about the meeting explaining unmasking for her part rice had been called to the house intelligence committee to testify partly over what nunes and other republicans believed was an abuse in the practice of unmasking or revealing the identities of americans who were communicating with foreign officials under surveillance by the us intelligence community simply unmasking the names of individuals in classified reports does not mean that their identities will be revealed publicly and rice denied to the committee that she leaked classified information to the press sources familiar with the matter said but rices suggestion that she unmasked the names of us individuals who turned out to be trump associates over concerns about the propriety of the crown princes visit to the united states could help her fend off attacks that she was out of line in the actions she took rep trey gowdy a south carolina republican who is helping lead the house investigation told the daily caller nothing that came up in her interview that led me to conclude that she improperly unmasked the names of trump associates or leaked it to the press sarah sanders the white house press secretary did not say explicitly whether trump still believes rice committed a crime but added the issue of leaking and unmasking needs to be investigated weve seen illegal leaking of classified materials including the identities of american citizens unmasked in intelligence reports sanders told cnn thats why the president called for congress to investigate this matter and why the department of justice and intelligence community are doing all they can to stamp out this dangerous trend that undermines our national security nunes was forced to step aside from running the russia investigation amid a house ethics inquiry into whether he improperly disclosed classified data the ethics inquiry came in the aftermath of his bombshell comments that obama administration officials had improperly unmasked the names of trump associates a revelation that trump used as cover for his unsubstantiated claim that obama had trump tower wiretapped during the election to spy on him the justice department said in a court filing friday that the doj and the fbi have no evidence to support trumps claims but on tuesday the republican who took over the investigation from nunes said there was no reason to bring rice in for further questioning she was a good witness answered all our questions rep mike conaway the texas republican now running the house russia probe told cnn im not aware of any reason to bring her back

politifact2131,1,july 25 tim geithner roundtable sundays 8854200 mr david gregory this sunday the president signs financial regulation this week as part of what the administration calls recovery summer but where are the jobs the fed chief says the future is uncertain will things get worse before they get better plus how washington s debate about your taxes will affect economic growth its all part of my oneon one discussion this morning with treasury secretary timothy geithner then the rush to judge agriculture official shirley sherrod secy tom vilsack this is a good woman shes been put through hell and i could have done and should have done a better job mr robert gibbs how did we not ask the right questions how did you all not ask the right questions how did other people not ask the right questions mr gregory what does this episode say about raciallycharged politics the media and the postracial presidency of barack obama our roundtable weighs in president of the national urban league marc morial former white house adviser anita dunn a man often credited with helping to spark the tea party movement cnbc s rick santelli new york times columnist david brooks and washington post columnist ej dionne announcer from nbc news in washington meet the press with david gregory mr gregory good morning a summer of anxiety over jobs the economy and government borrowing as new polling this week shows president obama s job approval rating handling the nation s economy at a new low on friday i sat down with the administration s top economic official treasury secretary tim geithner mr secretary welcome back to the program thank you for having us down to your office secy timothy geithner good to see you david mr gregory i want to ask you about some of the broader economic outlooks that weve heard across the the spectrum this week an important one from the fed chairman bernanke who said this week the outlook is unusually uncertain and i wonder if to you to the president that means you fear that things are going to get worse before they get better secy geithner i dont think theres anything unusual about the fact that given the severity of this crisis this recession given how bad it was just 18 months ago that americans are still living with some caution some sense of caution about the future i think thats natural unavoidable but you know the economy s now been growing for almost a year little more than a year private sector s creating jobs again the economy is starting to heal again youre seeing growth manufacturing private investment have recovered those are encouraging signs but were living still with a lot of challenge still because the scars of this crisis ran so deep and i think most americans understand its going to take some time to heal this mr gregory but unusually uncertain theres the prospect of a doubledip recession there are economists whove said you dont normally see this kind of anemic pace of recovery once a recovery begins secy geithner i i think i disagree slightly in the sense that you know remember this was a recession caused by a set of policies that left us with a 13 trillion deficit when the president came into office an economy that was falling off the cliff millions of americans had already lost their jobs the recession was a year old at that point and given that weve been living beyond our means as a country americans have been borrowing too much and you had a huge growth in risk taking and leverage in the financial system what you would expect is a more moderate pace for recovery than is typical and thats what were seeing but again you are seeing recovery youre seeing private investment expand again job growth starting to come back and thats very encouraging and if you look at what private forecasters say about the economy they see an economy thats going to continue to grow strengthen moderately over the next 18 months or so and i talked to businesses across the country and i would say that is the general view an economy that is gradually getting better mr gregory so just to be precise you do not believe in a doubledip recession that it will get worse before it gets better secy geithner no i dont i think the most likely thing is you see an economy that gradually strengthens over the next year or two you see job growth start to come back again again investments expanding manufacturings getting a little stronger exports better those are very encouraging signs but we got a long way to go still mr gregory you see this magazine i have the week and and the headline is where are the jobs the recession is over but no one is hiring why is particularly private sector hiring apparently so slow secy geithner theyre i think businesses across the country you know again faced with the prospect of an economy falling off the cliff are still cautious still very cautious so theyve been trying to get as much productivity out of their employees as possible theyre in a very strong financial conditions though and i think thats very promising because theres a lot of pentup demand and theres a lot of capacity still for them to step up and start to invest and hire again but youre seeing it start you know weve had six months of private sector job growth not as fast as we like not as fast as we need but i think youre going to see it again gradually start to get better mr gregory but why are why are businesses uncertain is it whats happened in europe in greece and in other places i mean in other words businesses are making money theyve got cash but they dont seem to want to invest it yet secy geithner they are again most important cause i think is the scars caused by the depth of the crisis what that did to confidence youre right though to mention europe you know when people got very worried about europe in the spring it did hurt confidence you saw equity prices fall around the world and that that absolutely had an effect that in produced a little more caution but that i believe is a temporary factor europe s moved very aggressively and theyre starting to get more confidence back in europe that they they have some traction on policies and theyre going to be able to put this behind them mr gregory but you still have both the political and the economic reality of this headline where are the jobs and the both political and economic reality is that most americans based on a variety of polling do not believe the administration s claim that the stimulus had made things better rather than left things largely unchanged and the criticism is primarily from the left that the stimulus was never big enough to really match up to the severity of the crisis so why not stimulate more why not spend more to do something to create more jobs secy geithner theres a lot of stimulus still in the pipeline you saw congress move this week to expand unemployment benefits the senate is about to consider a very powerful package of of tax cuts for small businesses help small businesses get access to credit thats very important and we think theres some more things congress can do to again to help reinforce this recovery but were in a transition david from the extraordinary actions the government had to take to break the back of this financial crisis to a recovery led by private demand that transition is well under way its going to continue its going to strengthen mr gregory so youre not prepared to say that more public works government spending is necessary secy geithner well i weve got a lot of challenges less left as a country still ahead of us we have very high rates of unemployment very high levels of longterm unemployed we want to make sure were strengthening the competitiveness of american companies across industries and weve got some longterm fiscal problems that are going to be a challenge for us as a country and were going to work to fix those problems we inherited but the best way to do that is to make sure were growing private investment starts to come back private firms start to hire again the government can help but we need to make this transition now to a recovery led by private investment private mr gregory and thats an important statement secy geithner it is mr gregory youre saying that indeed government should take its foot off the accelerator of stimulus secy geithner you know we have already moved very aggressively to unwind and walk back the emergency measures we had to put in place in the financial sector those were very effective bringing down the cost of borrowing we brought a lot of private capital in so that was the right thing to do then weve dialed those back very quickly right now we still think theres a good case for the government acting with targeted measures to help small businesses and help the unemployed help states keep teachers in the classroom those are sensible good steps but we have to make this transition to a recovery led by private companies mr gregory you talked about extending benefits to the unemployed when the president did that back in november of last year he trumpeted the fact that it was paid for that it wouldnt add to the deficit and yet the complaint from republicans this time is no such promise here this will add to the deficit why was it important then to make sure it was paid for but not now secy geithner i think this is a responsible way to do it you know my job david is to help make sure we can borrow to finance the obligations that congress gives us and i think its a prudent responsible way given the scale of the emergency the scale of the damage still facing america that we finance these additional support for the unemployed as well as the support for small business we think theres a good case for doing it now we want to do it in an overall fiscally responsible way and as you know the president has proposed a series of measures that will cut our deficits in half over the next several years thats important too for future growth were going to need to make sure we get that balance right mr gregory but again it was important to be paid for then but not now secy geithner david we can afford to do it this way im completely confident we can and if you look again at what were paying to borrow now weve got very low interest rates as a country in part because people around the world and americans have a lot of confidence in our capacity as a country to make sure we manage through these challenges mr gregory indeed thats the argument that is cited by those who say that government should spend more because the cost of borrowing right now theres all this debate about stimulus vs the debt a lot of people saying government spending s out of control but you just made the point it doesnt cost a lot to carry the debt right now why not spend more to create jobs when they dont appear to be materializing from the private sector secy geithner its a difficult balance again we are proposing to make sure were extending tax cuts that go to 95 percent of americans we extend a bunch of tax incentives to businesses to help encourage hiring investment we think those are sensible affordable steps we can we can afford to do that now but we have to make some choices too and we have to make sure we can continue to earn confidence around the world that were going to have the will as a country to bring these large inherited deficits down over time to a much more manageable level mr gregory let me talk about the achievement of financial reform legislation that youve worked so hard on the the pay czar ken feinberg has been working on compensation just issued a new report saying that at the height of the crisis you had some of the biggest banks paying bonuses that were not warranted do you have any way to get any of that money back secy geithner you know he spoke to that earlier congress did not give him the authority to do that but they did give him authority he used very effectively to change how wall street was paying its executives and he did an enormously important job in trying to make sure that we have in place ways to make sure these guys dont go back in the future dont go in the future back to paying executives to take risks that could imperil the stability of the economy he did a great job limited authority but he used that authority very well mr gregory the the issue is are we fighting the last war in financial reform to what extent do you look at this regime of new regulation and say well theres still a waitandsee aspect to this in terms of whether it could really do the job the next time because we dont know what the next times going to look like secy geithner we dont and that thats the basic strategy that is reflected in this bill the best way to make sure were protecting a financial system from future crisis we wont know the source we wont be able to anticipate preempt all those crisis is to make sure the system runs with much thicker shock absorbers much larger cushions financial resources against loss much stronger capital buffers so that they can withstand the kind of shock losses youd face in a recession like this thats the most effective thing you can do and this reform bill gives the government authority it did not have to make sure the system runs with these much more conservative constraints on risk taking mr gregory as someones who concerned about the overall growth of the economy the role of education innovation manufacturing does it trouble you that 25 percent of our economy is the financial sector which doesnt actually make anything besides money secy geithner i dont know what how large the system s going to be in the future you cant really tell but what were determined to do and what the reforms will do is to make sure this system goes back to its core purpose of taking the savings of americans and from investors around the world and allocating those to people with an idea not just the largest companies in the country but to small businesses with an idea and a plan for growing thats what systems have to do well our system at its best was the model for the world in doing that and these reforms will make sure we preserve that basic strength mr gregory a couple of questions about housing and taxes the housing market is still in a lot of trouble it was propped up with mortgage modification with the the tax benefits of buying new home thats now gone home sales have gone back down modifications have not worked there still has not met the goal of avoiding four million foreclosures im curious to know whether the president and you are committed to three critical areas the tax credit for mortgage interest the credit provided by fannie mae and freddie mac and the housing goals particularly for lowincome americas americans are you still committed to those three pillars secy geithner ill say the two things that guide us going forward now one is we want to make sure that we do what is necessary to make sure americans have the ability to borrow to finance the purchase of a house and we bring stability to house prices we help repair the huge damage done by the housing market and as you you still say its still you know in a lot of distress but weve brought a measure of stability to house prices interest rates have come down dramatically millions of americans have been able to refinance take advantage of lower rates which is much more money in their pockets and we put in place a very carefully designed mortgagemodification program to help people who have a chance to stay in their house take advantage of that chance now were going to make sure we continue to do whats necessary to again repair the damage of this housing crisis but we have to reform the system we have to bring to fannie and freddie to the gses and to the broader housing finance market a better set of policies to make sure we can deliver affordable finance for housing without leaving the economy vulnerable to this kind of crisis mr gregory but the housing goals because thats a big part of what fannie and freddie were doing of course again they they guarantee most of the debt the mortgage debt thats out there in the country secy geithner they do mr gregory and the government has now taken them over and they were private heretofore but it is a goal of getting people into homes is that still the goal because thats part of the problem right you had too many people in homes that couldnt afford to be there secy geithner david i were going to take a careful look at a set of reforms that are going to be good for the country going forward and dont leave us vulnerable to this kind of crisis in the future i personally believe that theres going to be a good case for the government preserving some type of guarantee to make sure that people have the ability to borrow to finance a house even in a very damaging recession i think theres going to be a good case for that mr gregory so fannie and freddie should not be dismantled secy geithner no thats thats different mr gregory thats different secy geithner i think were not going to preserve fannie and freddie in anything like their current form were going to have to bring fundamental change to that market but i think theres going to be a good case for taking a look at a preserving or putting in place a carefully designed guarantee so again homeowners have the ability to borrow to finance a home even in a very difficult recession but were also going to have to take a look at the broad set of policies we put in place to help encourage home ownership and particularly help lowincome americans get access to affordable housing were going to take a very broad look at at at how to best to do that were going to begin that process very quickly consult broadly and i think that theres going to be very broad support among republicans and democrats for a set of sensible reforms to fix this system mr gregory let me go through as quickly as i can some of the big tax issues the bush tax cuts set to expire the administration s plan is let them expire in other in other words raise taxes on wealthy americans above 250000 but dont let them expire keep them going for those 250000 or less even democrats like the chairman of the budget committee says bad idea to raise taxes on wealthy americans until youve got a recovery on sounder footing any wiggle room on that any prospect of change secy geithner i i i dont i dont think its quite a fair description of senator conrad s views but i wont speak to them but ill say what the president believes and i believe this is the right thing for the country the fair thing the responsible thing for the country now is to make sure we leave in place and preserve tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working americans and complement those with a set of incentives for businesses to expand and hire to make that possible and to do that responsibly i think it is fair and good policy to allow those tax cuts that only go to 2 to 3 percent of the highest earners in the country to expire as scheduled the country can withstand that the economy can withstand that i think its good policy mr gregory would you like to see the capital gains tax stay at 20 percent secy geithner i would mr gregory and so youll push for that secy geithner yeah and and we dont want to see the rate of dividends exceed that either because again we want to make sure we have policies in place overall across the economy thats going to make sure were encouraging investment encouraging growth as this economy recovers mr gregory if deficits are unsustainable can you give an example yet of a painful choice that the presidents prepared to make to bring our fiscal house in order secy geithner oh absolutely i mean again hes proposed to freeze discretionary spending to keep the overall size of the government at a very modest level as a share of our economy if you look again at what the presidents proposing he keeps the overall size of government at a very modest level comparable to lower than what was in the bush administration comparable to what president reagan presided over thats very important that is a difficult thing to do when we face so many challenges as a country but hes also proposing as you as you said david to allow these tax cuts for the highest earners to expire on schedule hes proposed to reinstate a bunch of disciplines that helped produce the large surpluses of the clinton era now and those those policies will bring our deficits down by more than half over the next several years mr gregory final question the president talked about the fact that like a lot of americans who are saving for their kids educations his 529 or college savings plan for his daughters has gone down in value a lot of people think about secy geithner well its come up dramatically mr gregory come up all right but its still mr gregory from his first few months in office mr gregory ok yeah right but this is a serious point because a lot of people think about this and about investing in the market for the future as youve passed financial regulation what is a fair expectation for americans to have out of the capital markets if they see that as a place for savings when for so many years weve heard hey youll get 10 to 15 percent returns over the longterm is that what americans can really expect secy geithner i think what they can expect from these reforms is much more accessible much more simple much clearer disclosure about the terms in which they can borrow to finance education for their children borrow to finance a home borrow to finance a car take a credit card much more clear transparent simple disclosure than they had over the past several decades and much better information about the risks you take in investing thats a sensible thing for the government to do now of course you need people to be able to make responsible decisions we cant make those decisions for those individuals theyve got to take that responsibility themselves mr gregory but hasnt the world fundamentally changed in the markets that you simply cannot expect to get the kind of return on investment that youve enjoyed and so many americans have enjoyed for so many years secy geithner i think its hard to know what you want people doing is making better decisions more careful decisions about how much of their income they spend how much of their income they save what they use those savings for how much they borrow and i think the trauma caused by this crisis is going to be profound and longlasting and youre already seeing it induce i think an ultimately healthy and necessary change in behavior because people are already saving more of their income and i think thats going to be a good thing for the country mr gregory secretary geithner thank you secy geithner nice to see you david mr gregory and coming up next the rush to judge shirley sherrod what happened and why the politics of race in what many thought would be a postracial era our roundtable weighs in the national urban league s marc morial former white house adviser anita dunn cnbc s rick santelli david brooks of the new york times and the washington post s ej dionne right here only on meet the press mr gregory coming up the fallout from the firing what does shirley sherrod s dismissal tell us about race politics and the media after this brief commercial break mr gregory and we are back shirley sherrod the agriculture official wrongly accused of harboring racist views and fired based on those accusations became an unlikely household name this week there is plenty of blame to go around for this episode and we will discuss that in just a moment but one question hung in the air this week werent discussions about race supposed to get better in the obama era it was during the presidential campaign of 2008 that senator obama set an example for how to discuss race he had to explain controversial remarks his former pastor reverend jeremiah wright made from the pulpit obama s point you have to put someone views in the context of their life experience sen barack obama even for those blacks who did make it questions of race and racism continue to define their worldview in fundamental ways for the men and women of reverend wrights generation the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years mr gregory ironically that is exactly what sherrod was trying to say in the speech that was edited to make her sound like a racist her point was that she once held prejudices but found a way to overcome them and help a white farmer in need ms shirley sherrod this whole incident helped me to feel a little more that we seem to be going backwards instead of forward in terms of race relations mr gregory a teachable moment mr robert gibbs i think a teachable moment is a moment in which the facts change and you react to the different those different facts i think this is one of those moments and i think thats whats happening mr gregory still this was not the kind of internet and cable newsfed spectacle the white house wanted to see let alone be part of while its trying to get americans back to work and while the president was signing a major piece of financial reform legislation and it wasnt the first time the white house has been thrown off track one year ago another racially charged incident after the arrest of harvard professor henry louis gates jr the president reacted pres obama i think its fair to say number one any of us would be pretty angry number two that the cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home mr gregory and then later expressed regret for a poor choice of words he said and for ratcheting up the controversy then there was a summit over a beer what now change comes slowly observers say and only if moments like this are used to teach fmr rep kweisi mfume dmd we measure race relations in baby steps not giant steps and thats why its taken us 300 years of slavery and a hundred years of jim crow to get beyond it and to get to where we are mr gregory back in 2008 senator obama was humble about how his election might impact race in america but he was adamant about one thing but race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now sen obama and yet if were not ignoring it the question is are we talking about it in a way that anyone would think is actually constructive im going to pose that question to the roundtable joining me now to discuss all the angles of this as well as the entire political landscape as well former obama white house adviser anita dunn cnbc s rick santelli the national urban league s marc morial the washington post s ej dionne and david brooks of the new york times welcome to all of you mr gregory nice to be back mr marc morial marc morial this was as as the conversation about race always is became emotional politically charged and it happened in a heartbeat so to my question are we better off for this experience are we having a constructive conversation about race in america mr gregory if we take the proper positive steps coming out of this experience we can be better off there are three things i observed one dont forget that this started when mr breitbart threw a firecracker in a crowded room mr morial this is this is the conservative blogger andrew breitbart mr gregory he threw a firecracker in a crowded room he yelled fire in a crowded theater and doctored a video which caused an innocent hardworking responsible woman whose story was of racial reconciliation to be cast in a negative light and then it began from there so thats certainly an important takeaway the second important takeaway is the story of shirley sherrod and the spooners and that is a story of reconciliation its a story of people who came to respect each other its a woman who was willing to admit that she had some animus and that she worked to overcome it and third thing id say david is this week in washington the urban league s going to have 10000 people here for our centennial conference were going to have a constructive discussion about race and education race and jobs race and health care a constructive discussion and i d invite people to follow that discussion this week mr morial and the president will be speaking there right mr gregory the president will be there secretary duncan will be there we have tim kaine and michael steele weve got business leaders weve got a bit of a mix across the spectrum wholl be there to talk positively about the pressing issues that face the country mr morial anita dunn you worked in the white house mr gregory mmhmm ms anita dunn as an adviser on communications matters and i want to get your response to maureen dowd s column in the new york times mr gregory yes ms dunn this morning because shes got some sharp words quoting the african american congressman james clyburn of south carolina put a portion of it up on the screen i dont think a single black person was consulted before shirley sherrod was fired i mean cmon said congressman clyburn of south carolina the presidents getting hurt real bad clyburn told me he needs some black people around him he said obama s inner circle keeps screwing up on race some people over there are not sensitive at all about race they really feel that the extent to which he allows himself to talk about race would tend to pigeonhole him or cost him support when a lot of people saw his election as a way to get the idea behind us i dont think people elected him to disengage on race just the opposite the president shouldnt give sherrod her old job back he should give her a new job director of black outreach the white house needs one those are strong words mr gregory those are strong words david i think that there are a lot of people who look back at the last week and wish they had behaved very differently i think there are plenty of people in the news media who wish that they had stopped and thought about kind of the fundamental job of journalism before they started asking for reaction to something that wasnt their based on their original reporting i think that the naacp wishes that they had not moved as quickly as they did and i dont think anybody is saying that the naacp you know needs more africanamericans and heaven knows that tom vilsack who has taken responsibility and who has said how badly he screwed up and the white house which knows how badly they screwed up have moved but i think there are a couple of things here one is that this extraordinary screwup happened and it was bad the white house and vilsack moved quite quickly to fix it and i think thats what people need to do when they make mistakes i think that the broader question though which is you know how is this suddenly barack obama s problem he has written an entire book about race in his book audacity of hope he devotes an entire chapter he made the speech in 2008 he has probably spoken more to this issue ms dunn but theres a skittishness mr gregory and thought more about this issue ms dunn but what clyburn is getting at is a skittishness about really confronting problems when they are you know when they spring up like this however whether there were screwups made to deal with them headon mr gregory well you know david its funny to me because i think that so much of this resulted from what was kind of a false metanarrative that was developing last week as you recall i mean you know you talked about context and the presidents talked about context ms dunn right mr gregory the context for this was not just that andrew breitbart decided to edit to put an edited video to make a point he was trying to make the point that the naacp is a racist organization so lets start with that kind of fun fun box here then the week before that the naacp had had a resolution ok thats called on the tea party movement to expel from its midst anybody who harbors racist sentiments ms dunn right mr gregory the tea party movement came back and said that makes the naacp racist theyre being racist towards us ms dunn all right and this is the broader context ej let me mr gregory but this is the broader context ok ms dunn right let me bring you into this ej because you wrote in a column this mr gregory the bludgeoning of mainstream journalism into looking timorously over its right shoulder and believing that balance demands taking seriously whatever sludge the far right is pumping into the political waters what do we take from this week yet the obama team was reacting to a reality well that yeah thats my column tomorrow in the post i mean first of mr ej dionne can we have a good discussion on race we cant have a good discussion on race if the facts dont matter and i think its its not only that shirley sherrod was smeared it was a perverse smear because if you look at that speech what she was giving is a speech about racial reconciliation she was saying poor blacks and poor whites have a lot in common and this was twisted into a an allegation false allegation that she was somehow a black racist now whats going on here i think the traditional media are so afraid of being called liberal god forbid they be called liberal that they are willing to run with any kind of rightwing propaganda and treat it as news challenging propaganda or not running it or taking your time before you run with a story thats not liberalism thats journalism and i think that the right has been running this campaign for 30 years theyve had a lot of success and we should worry about it with the you got to look over both shoulders and you got to look at the facts all you asked right at the beginning a good question theres not only a rightwing squabble media i mean theres a squabble culture out there theres regular media we were trained in one media when i mr david brooks if your mother tells you she loves you check it out and so thats it that you would never run an excerpt from a speech unless you saw the speech thats just unthinkable started working in chicago we were given a phrase right mr dionne mmhmm ms dunn so we were trained in a certain way a different sort of media squabble culture has come up on the left and the right which which decides their they build audience by destroying other people they dont know anything about policy they dont care about government they just want that squabble mr brooks but mr gregory but but mr dionne and my rule is i mean for somebody what anita was doing mr brooks yeah mr gregory stay away from the squabble culture dont get in there and thats true for us and i would say thats true mr brooks ok well let me just say something really quickly that is easier said than done when the white house press secretary walks into the room and the only question people want to ask is how are you going to react what are you going to do what are you going to do what are you going to do ms dunn right rick mr gregory and you have a false a false fact an edited speech as as ej says that was designed to create this outcome that becomes the news of the day ok ms dunn well then play by different rules maybe before firing somebody call them up and talk to them mr brooks right but rick mr gregory i i couldnt agree with you more there ok so ms dunn rick santelli but i want to bring you into this as well and because the the political dimension of this you know the naacp making the charge against the you know the tea party the tea party in some ways responding in kind by going after sherrod eugene mr gregory with the obama presidency has come a flurry of charges from the likes of andrew breitbart but also from more substantial conservative figures about alleged incidences of racial discrimination against whites by blacks and other minorities these allegations of anti white racism are being deliberately hyped and exaggerated because they are designed to make whites fearful it wont work with most people of course but it works with some enough perhaps to help erode obama s political standing and damage his partys prospects at the polls that this is a political strategy robinson wrote this in his column which was provocative first of all we should have zero tolerance for racial discrimination period beyond that if the indirect question is is the tea party racist i think the real question is are there racists in the tea party and i would contend that statistically theres going to be racists in any group i think the tea party is more a thought more a feeling more a philosophy than it is a party and i think in february of 09 when i was the lightning rod for this movement in many ways many different diverse groups of people from all walks of life all races all from different areas of the socioeconomic spectrum all intersect in an area thats philosophical and i think the issue is fiscal responsibility but with that theres a less spending issue less spending affects entitlements and if you connect the dots ultimately what we are the the tea party seems to represent is a movement that we can control spending and we can have good strategies without negatively impacting minorities which might be a higher proportion of some of these programs again affected by spending mr rick santelli marc morial i want to bring you in back to this question of what james congressman clyburn is saying which is that there is a a an unwillingness by this administration and this president to engage on matters of race because of a kind of skittishness not wanting to get too close to it mr gregory let me mr morial is that fair mr gregory i think theres two things mr morial because the president said you heard him in 2008 we must we cant ignore it mr gregory the president would benefit by a broad circle of external advisers and maybe some internal advisers who have the experience particularly in the south the contemporary experience of the civil rights movement that could serve as a sounding board and i think that this president would benefit and every president would benefit by having those type of people those experiences in his circle of advisers the second thing i just want to say is to what rick said what i saw from the tea party and this is what many of us reacted to were the aspersions on congressman lewis the aspersions on congressman clyburn the awful billboard certainly repudiated now which compared the president of the united states the elected leader of this great democracy with two of the worst figures in 20th century history adolph hitler and lenin mr morial right mr gregory and i asked myself though would i ever have seen a president bush a president clinton a president nixon ever portrayed in that fashion so sometimes what people react to is not whats stated mr morial right mr gregory but they also react to what they see mr morial but but ej you made the point in a column you said look i mean there theres extremists on the left i mean there are there are movements that have people who go way beyond the pale on both the left and the right mr gregory i actually what the point i made in that column was that going back in the 1960s mr dionne right ms dunn to the 1960s when folks were burning flags mainstream liberals were asked to repudiate flag burning and they did mr dionne mmhmm ms dunn mmhmm mr gregory and the naacp did not say mr dionne right ms dunn that the tea party is racist they made a very careful statement where they were saying that there is racism in the tea party and it ought to be repudiated mr dionne theres racism in the tea party the democratic party the republican party mr santelli no but but no this is mr dionne and and ms dunn moral equivalence this is not the case mr dionne no ms dunn look there is a concerted conservative campaign on part of the movement a minority of the movement mr dionne right ms dunn to use race to split people glenn beck says obama has a deepseated hatred for white people j christian adams a republican activist pushing this new black panthers story says the obama justice department is motivated by a lawless hostility toward equal enforcement of the law now there are people playing with this racial politics out there i am not saying the naacp certainly isnt saying that this is the whole conservative movement mr dionne right ms dunn or most of the conservative movement or most of the tea party but its a part of this strategy and people should condemn it mr dionne but the mr santelli there are liberals who call conservatives racist as a matter of tactics too that happens as well listen i was out jogging you wouldnt know it to look at me i was out jogging in the mall i was at a tea party rally tea party rally also there was a group called the back black family reunion celebration of africanamerican culture i watched these two groups intermingle sitting at the same table eating watching concerts together among most of those people there was a fantastic atmosphere of just getting along on a on a warm sunday afternoon and so there are people but i was struck by a story of progress a story of progress that were making some progress to this and this whole week that speech was about progress we now have a gotcha culture that punishes people that say terrible things so i think overall its slow steady progress mr brooks but can i can i add into the mix here in this week of this emotionally charged discussion came senator jim webb a democrat virginia who wrote an oped piece mr gregory diversity and the myth of white privilege the subhead america still owes a debt to its black citizens but government programs to help all people of color are unfair they should end anita dunn i mean there are those even in the democratic party who are saying look we have to have a real conversation about these issues that raised a lot of eyebrows well put the headline on the screen and i dont think theres anybody whos saying we shouldnt have a real conversation about these issues but i also dont think theres anybody at this table or frankly most people in america who think that an edited twoandahalfminute clip that begins driving the news that has reporters saying hows the white house going to react its a huge problem its a huge problem are they going to fire her what are they going to do what are they going to do thats not a reasoned conversation i think a reasoned conversation is exactly what the president has tried to promote throughout his career and that he has said we need to have but lets not mistake whats been going on over the past week for any kind of reasoned conversation there was the rush to judgment on shirley sherrod and now theres a new metanarrative i think based on another false premise the idea that somehow barack obama is the problem with race relations in america or the reason we dont have a conversation i dont think thats true either ms dunn but you know david i want to say this mr morial yeah ms dunn one of the things this distracts from is the news of the week that the senate cut out 1 billion for summer jobs but is prepared to spend 60 billion on a troop surge if in afghanistan one of the things this distracts from has been the repeated use of the filibuster to block legislation and block measures that would help the economy in urban communities and that to me mr morial let me mr gregory wait a minute wait a minute mr santelli that to me and the persistent use of the filibuster it being used more times in the last two years than in the previous century mr morial all right mr gregory to stop this legislation greatly concerns me mr morial quick quick rick great hold the thought though i want to get your reaction to jim webb s point in his editorial mr gregory i dont agree that latinos and asians have not suffered discrimination in this country or that native americans have not suffered discrimination in this country i think the question is how do you target and tailor policies that are going to help all economically and socially disadvantaged people and its a fair debate to have but it also needs to be positive with facts look at the latino unemployment rate its higher than the white rate the black rate is higher than the latino rate so to suggest that there are not disparities that affect the latino community that affect the native american community most in depth the african american community weve got to have the discussion that jim webb wants to have we have facts real facts that give a picture of how life is in this nation mr morial all right rick make your point then i want to take a break mr gregory fortyone cents of every dollar this government spends in fiscal 2010 goes to pay debt its borrowed money fortyone cents of every dollar marcus we have a 3 12 trillion 2010 budget lets look at that 34 billion for extension these people need help but to think that this administration and in timothy geithner s interview he talks about getting their fiscal house in order in a 3 12 trillion budget they cant come up with a way to offset 34 billion in spending it isnt that the conservatives want to be meanspirited its that at the end game if the country is broke everybody loses mr santelli all right were going to take a break here we will pick up talking more about the geithner interview the economy and politics in our remaining moments with our roundtable dont go away right after this brief station break mr gregory were back with our roundtable so much to get to and frankly not enough time but santelli s taking over your role hes setting up the next topic beautifully that segue artist that ej normally is i want to talk about the economy and and some of what secretary geithner said that i thought was was pretty striking but first let me show you a couple of things a poll from bloomberg just about a week ago asking are you better off than you were 18 months ago look at that 17 percent say yes worse off 29 percent or about the same 54 percent thats after the stimulus plan mr gregory polls suggest that an energized core of voters possibly around 40 percent has ideologically recoiled from obama s direction that threatens democrats but their greater problem is that voters open to an activist government in principle are not convinced that its producing enough benefits in practice david brooks government has not proven to be the answer and yet thats the fundamental argument from the administration ron brownstein in his column in the national journal says this in the political context right theres been a theres been a massive recall in the past year the obama administration has dropped about 20 percent among independent voters in part because of the debt and other issues but faith in government has plummeted back to its historic lows faith in congress this week hit an 11 percent an historic low forever so how do you persuade people that you can do things when you have that kind of distrust and that hasnt been solved the stimulus obviously created some jobs but the fact is its taken forever to get out and the underlying reality is the more the debt goes up the more people are scared and the more theyre scared especially small business theyre just not investing mr brooks but rick santelli this is again and the liberal argument which i brought up to secretary geithner is to challenge your point of view hey wait a minute youre raising the red flag about debt yes theyre unsustainable but the cost of borrowing money right now is so low that when youre in this kind of exigent circumstance economically why not measure spending commensurate with the size of the the financial hole were in mr gregory lets cover three areas on that first of all when people get addicted to bad substances usually the people that supply it give them really good prices in the early days i dont think its a great idea that we are enamored with the fact that we can sell so much debt because it could all change very quickly at the end of last year a greek sixmonth bond was around 2 percent its more than doubled and its only seven months into the year mr santelli were not greece we can print money mr gregory were not greece yet but that could be the ghost of the economy of the future if we stay on this unsustainable path the other thing is theres some of us out there that dont believe the stimulus or the recovery package or the tarp did what it sold matter of fact my opinion would be that what weve done is weve created a sixday cure for a threeday flu mr santelli the issue of taxes anita dunn is front page on the morning papers today in mr gregory battle looms on tax breaks as the bush era cuts are at issue the new york times next big battle in washington bush s tax cuts if the administration is serious about cutting the deficit why keep any of these tax cuts going because extending tax cuts to the middle class those 250000 100000 or less is going to cost about 250 billion to do next year the post and the times the washington post front page david the president was very clear as a candidate in 2008 as president in 2009 and 2010 which is he believes that the middle class of this country pays enough in taxes and should not have a tax increase he believes that theyre stressed enough and that theyre and that they lost ground over the last decade and that hes not going to raise taxes on them ms dunn but let me just stop you mr gregory he was very clear but no but ms dunn hold on i want to stop you mr gregory yeah ms dunn on this issue of tough choices because i pressed the mr gregory right uhhuh ms dunn republicans on this it is tough to say to the american people mr gregory yes ms dunn i know you pay too much but i cant do it now if i want to be serious about the deficit why not say to the american people you got to sacrifice we got to get rid of all these tax cuts if if its a bad idea which is what democrats believe that the tax cuts were a bad idea mr gregory no democrats didnt believe all of those tax cuts were a bad idea as a matter of fact david there were battles in 2001 and 2003 from democrats to do things like double the child care tax credit to make the tax cuts more progressive at the bottom end so they didnt believe all of those tax cuts were a bad idea either in 2001 or in 2003 what they did believe and what they continue to believe is that the is that the very very highest and then the people who did the best the 2 percent 2 percent of the 300 million people in this country that they can pay a little more during this time but in terms of the deficit piece of this the president is absolutely convinced and is taking steps there is a bipartisan deficit commission and i know in washington bipartisan commissions come and go but this is a very serious effort and it will come back with recommendations and there are going to be tough choices in there the presidents already directed his cabinet agencies to cut their spending there are going to be tough choices in there and there have to be because i think everyone recognizes that ms dunn ive got about three minutes left ej you can weigh in on that but i want to show the president spoke to the netroots conference over the weekend so this is a developing story about the obama agenda and some of the complaints from the left and i just want to play a portion of that mr gregory so in ways large and small weve begun to deliver on the change you fought so hard for and were not done were working to repeal dont ask dont tell were working to close guantanamo in a responsible way and thanks to the heroism of our troops we are poised to end our combat mission in iraq by the end of august completing a drawdown of more than 90000 troops since i took office were moving america forward and when weve come this far we cant afford to slide backward pres obama whats striking about that is that the president has a problem with independent voters but hes also got those on the left who are pretty disappointed mr gregory right now you think thats important to the outcome of the election i just want to say one thing on this tax issue warren buffet very famously said that he pays tax at a lower rate than his receptionist because of the way we tax dividends and capital gains the truly rich people in the country according to a study last year the 400 richest people pay taxes at a lower rate in effect than firefighters than police officers than shop clerks thats why we need to raise taxes on the very wealthy to cover the deficit because guess what the tax increases on the wealthy do not have an antistimulative effect the way tax cuts on average people do barack obama was very smart to do that he needed to do that theyre the democrats are going to be in trouble if their own people dont turn out right now rick santelli s tea party has really motivated a lot of people on the right the administration and democrats have to do a lot more motivating on their side mr dionne let let me get your thoughts about fiscal responsibility but save me 30 seconds to talk about charlie rangel ok mr gregory oh i warren buffet pays cap gains rates which theyre not going to raise theyre raising the rates as income tax rates that doesnt matter listen my view of the of fiscal policy and the economy is just not that strong weve learned you can pump a lot of the money youre not going to get shortterm buzz you should think longterm what can we do longterm to get fair taxes simple taxes structure and innovation so i i think the idea were going to fix the economy or fiscal policy in the next six months or a year its fallacious mr brooks marc morial can can charlie rangel survive the ethics trouble hes in mr gregory last time i walked through the streets of harlem charlie rangel still has incredible support and i think what this week tells us is lets not prejudge charlie rangel charlie rangel has a right to be heard and i think we need to hear his side of the story hes a great congressman hes a great american mr morial but anita dunn the last thing democrats want right now is a full airing of ethics charges against one of their members when congress rates it about 11 percent approval mr gregory youre arguing it could go lower no here i i think that we have to think about what marc morial just said because the reality is we should listen to him in context before we judge ms dunn all right were going to leave it there thank you all pretty spirited discussion we will be right back mr gregory that is all for today but before we go a quick programming note tune into nbc tonight at 7 pm eastern for the dateline special with ann curry america now friends neighbors which will examine the impact of the recession on the poor well be back next week if its mr gregory

politifact787,1,he says universal but its no guarantee under attack at a recent debate from rival hillary clinton on health care barack obama shot back well lets talk about health care right now because the fact of the matter is that i do provide universal health care the only difference between sen clintons health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated forced them to get health care before jumping into this fray its important to note that when it comes to health care the two democratic presidential candidates have a lot in common one of the few differences is that clinton includes a universal mandate that means that after everything else goes according to plan individuals will be required by law to purchase insurance think of how people are required to buy auto insurance and you get an idea of what that might look like obamas plan includes a mandate to insure children but it does not include a mandate for adults as the clinton and edwards plans do that likely means not as many people will be insured said kenneth thorpe professor of health policy and management at emory university sign up for politifact texts obamas decision not to include a mandate is a more cautious approach one obama says is designed not to penalize people with modest incomes if premiums dont drop enough after all the reforms are implemented people will still be unable to afford insurance if a law mandates they buy it anyway they probably wont obamas argument is that if you then fine them youre essentially punishing the poor and they will still be uninsured obama is betting that his plan will get costs low enough that many of the estimated 47million uninsured will sign up without a mandate and a mandate will come later so is it fair for obama to call his plan universal well not really even if you buy his argument that his plan will create the market conditions to make health care universally available nothing in his plan guarantees it we rate his claim barely true

politifact5237,1,morgan griffith says epa treats milk spills same way as oil spills us rep h morgan griffith is milking his opposition to the environmental protection agency for every last drop the republican stressed his contempt for the agency throughout a heated campaign last fall in which griffith unseated democrat rick boucher a 14term congressman from coalrich southwest virginia in his victory speech griffith vowed to go to washington and fight to rein in the epa since taking office he has fired out a barrage of antiepa statements in a february newsletter to constituents griffith claimed that new epa rules treat milk spills the same way they treat oil spills he titled the newsletter crying over spilt milk what do spilt milk and oil have in common he wrote quite a bit according to the epa in fact a new ruling by the epa would force dairy farmers to comply with the spill prevention control and countermeasure program when dealing with spilt milk the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow the epas reasoning is that milk contains a percentage of animal fats which is a nonpetroleum oil it appears spilt milk is just as threatening as an oil spill with visions of dairy farmers delicately dabbing milk off the wings of ducks we looked into the claim beth breeding griffiths press secretary said her bosss information came from the epas website so we went there right away we found problems with griffiths claim the website says milk has been regulated under the spill prevention control and countermeasure program since 1973 when the clean water act took effect the law was passed by congress the preceding year over the veto of republican president richard nixon so this is hardly a new ruling as griffith says it has been in effect for 38 years the epa site says since the spcc rule became law in 1973 all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils such as animal fats and vegetable oils have been considered oils this is because the spcc rule gets its definition of oil from the clean water act which was authored by congress the website also notes the rule only applies to farms storing more than 1320 gallons of oil or milk so whats new according to the epa the only thing that comes close is a rule change it announced on jan 15 2009 it goes in effect at the end of this month the simple purpose of the change is to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products thats the exact opposite of what griffith claims heres what the regulation says epa proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the spcc requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3a sanitary standards and are subject to the current applicable grade a pasteurized milk ordinance or similar state laws translated into plain english the rule means milk storage will no longer have to meet the epas oil spill rules provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws in virginia it is illegal to sell raw or unpasteurized milk so the states dairy farmers should already be in compliance with the new standards raw milk is now legal for sale in 25 states although 15 of those states only allow sales directly from a farm so conceivably raw milk producers which are almost exclusively small operations according to a group that advocates for raw milk might still need to comply with the spcc rules but this would affect only a very small fraction of total us milk baffled by how griffith could have this claim so mixed up we went back to his office for additional information the second time around his press secretary pointed us to a jan 27 editorial in the wall street journal that makes virtually the same claim the editorial wrongly said new epa rules will apply to dairy farms and cover milk storage the amended rule only applies to petroleum products gasoline fuel oil and the like that are stored in large quantities on dairy farms lets review our findings griffith claimed a new ruling by the epa would force dairy farmers to comply with strict regulations for spills and leaks he said the rules were the same as those enforced on oil and natural gas companies in fact these regulations have been in place for 38 years and are not new at all the new ruling from the epa announced in 2009 and taking effect in a few weeks actually excludes milk from the spill standards giving dairy farmers fewer regulations to meet thats the exact opposite of what griffith claims sure griffith got some of his information from an inaccurate editorial in the wall street journal but a congressman who is railing against a federal agency has the means to get his facts right griffith is dishing udder cow chips we rate his statement false
